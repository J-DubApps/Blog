<i>Contacting Me… </i><br /><br />

<div style="font-size: 14px;">
I welcome and look forward to questions or comments (good or bad) about julianwest.me, so feel free to write me, DM, etc.<br /><br />
I do receive a fair amount of email every day. If I don’t respond to your email quickly, or if my response is indefinitely delayed, please don’t be offended. It’s possible I may missed your email, but try to read all email and chances are I will see it.<br /><br />
Note to IT job recruiters: please do not write to me at my personal email address unless we've already been corresponding, I monitor my LinkedIn profile and respond to smessages pretty quickly. Thanks.
