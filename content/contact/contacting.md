# Contacting Me… <br /><br />

I welcome and look forward to questions or comments (good or bad) about julianwest.me, so feel free to write me, DM, etc.<br /><br />
I do receive a fair amount of email every day. If I don’t respond to your email quickly, or if my response is indefinitely delayed, please don’t be offended. It’s possible I may missed your email, but try to read all email and chances are I will see it.<br /><br />
Note to IT job recruiters: please do not write to me at my personal email address (unless you’re Apple, Google, or Cisco you’ll probably hit a filter), and instead please make any unsolicited correspondence via my LinkedIn profile. I answer all messages eventually. Thanks.
