#### _Trivial stuff_

<div style="font-size: 8px;">
I am into technology, art, and good design...and also random geekery (board gaming, etc).<br />  
I was born in rural Texas, to parents both born before 1930 (I am late for everything).<br />     
I was raised in poverty and my small family even briefly experienced homelessness. My earliest education.<br />
I am a self-made man with the past mistakes to prove it. I keep growing and learning every day.<br />      
Writing code changed my life along with curiosity, Macs, and PCs.<br />   
Myers-Briggs says I am INTP, but I like people. At least the cool ones.<br />   
My close friends call me “Jules”, maybe seven people. The cool ones.<br />   
For a living I’m an ops nerd and I manage IT network projects & deployments.<br />   
Despite managing Cisco/Microsoft/Linux systems, I am a huge Apple geek. This is not an uncommon thing nowadays.<br />   
I drive an electric car built in California which unfortunately transformed an autistic immigant billionaire into a problematic Oligarch. Still pondering that one.<br />   
For hobbies I write and strum a guitar and develop messy PowerShell and Python code.
