#### _Trivial trivia_

<div style="font-size: 14px;">
I love technology, art, and good design...and random board game geekery.<br />
For a living I’m an ops nerd and I manage IT network projects & deployments.<br />   
I was born in rural Texas, to parents both born before 1930 (I am late for everything).<br />
I was raised in poverty and my small family even briefly experienced homelessness. Wouldn't trade those days for anything.<br />
I am a self-made man with the past mistakes to prove it. I keep growing and learning every day.<br />      
Writing code changed my life along with curiosity, Macs, and PCs.<br />   
Myers-Briggs says I am INTP, but I like people. At least the cool ones.<br />   
My close friends call me “Jules”, maybe seven people. The cool ones.<br /> 
Despite managing Cisco/Microsoft/Linux systems, I am a huge Apple geek. This is not an uncommon thing nowadays.<br />   
I drive a California EV that that unfortunately is synonymous with an autistic immigant Oligarch.<br />   
For hobbies I write and strum a guitar and develop messy PowerShell and Python code.
