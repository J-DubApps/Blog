#### _Trivial trivia_
<div style="font-size: 14px;">
I love technology, art, and good design...and the random board game.<br />
For a living I’m an ops nerd working IT network projects & cloud deployments.<br />   
I was born in rural Texas, to parents both born before 1930 (I am late for everything).<br />
I grew up in poverty, nothing unique but those humble experiences helped shaped me.<br />
I am a self-made man with the past mistakes to prove it. I keep growing and learning every day.<br />      
Writing code changed my life, along with tech and curiosity.<br />   
Myers-Briggs says I am INTP, but I do like people. At least the cool ones.<br />   
My close earliest friends call me “Jules”, lately "JDub" is the nickname and <a href="https://github.com/J-DubApps" style="text-decoration: none;">GitHub username</a><br /> 
Despite managing Cisco/Microsoft/Linux systems, I am a huge Apple geek. This is not an uncommon thing nowadays.<br />   
I am an EV fan and Tesla early-adopter. Nice car despite the association with a certain autistic immigant Oligarch.&#129335;<br />   
For hobbies I write, play guitar/ukelele, and develop messy PowerShell and Python code. <br />
