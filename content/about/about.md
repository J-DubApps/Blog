#### _Trivial stuff_


I am a working-glass geek into technology, art, and good design.<br />  
I was raised in rural Texas by parents who were both born before 1931 (I am late for everything).<br />   
I am a self-made man with all the past mistakes to prove it. I keep growing and learning every day.<br />   
I endured a term of poverty growing up, including a very brief period of homelessness. It was an education I wouldn’t trade for anything.<br />     
Writing code changed my life along with curiosity, Macs, and PCs.<br />   
Myers-Briggs says I am INTP, but I like people. At least the cool ones.<br />   
My close friends call me “Jules”, maybe seven people. The cool ones.<br />   
For a living I’m an ops nerd and I manage IT network projects & deployments.<br />   
I am, despite the Cisco/Microsoft/Linux IT gig, a huge Apple geek. This is not an uncommon thing nowadays.<br />   
I drive an electric car built in California which unfortunately transformed an autistic immigant billionaire into a problematic Oligarch. Still pondering that one.<br />   
For hobbies I write and strum a guitar and develop messy PowerShell and Python code.
