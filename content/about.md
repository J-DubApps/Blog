<b><i>Trivial trivia üëáüèª</b></i> <br />
I love technology, art, and good design...and the occasional board game.<br />
For a living I‚Äôm an ops nerd working IT network projects & cloud deployments.<br />   
I was raised in rural Texas, born to parents who were <i>both</i> born before 1931 (I am late for everything).<br />
I grew up in poverty, nothing unique but I wouldn't trade those early experiences for anything.<br />
I am a self-made man with the past mistakes to prove it. I keep growing and learning every day.<br />      
Writing code changed my life, along with tech and curiosity.<br />   
Myers-Briggs says I am INTP, but I do like people. At least the cool ones.<br />   
My earliest friends call me ‚ÄúJules‚Äù, late-comers "JDub".  Who cares as long as I answer.<br />
I once met Quentin Tarantino and William Shatner. Not at the same time.<br />
Despite managing Cisco/Microsoft/Linux systems, I am a huge Apple geek. Not that uncommon.<br />   
I am an EV fan and Tesla early-adopter. Was a great car in spite of a certain autistic immigant Oligarch out there wilding.&#129335;<br />   
For hobbies I write, play guitar/ukelele, and develop messy PowerShell and Python code. <br /><br />
