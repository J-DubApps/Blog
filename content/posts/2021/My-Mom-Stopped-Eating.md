…and drinking. Her skilled-nursing staff have intervened and started an IV this morning, in an effort to avoid dehydration and see if she will perk-up and eat and drink again. We went through this in 2019 from late June until early August. But back then she weighed a lot more. She has been steadily losing interest in food the past two months, and appears to have lost some weight. I cannot help but feel all these lockdowns and the pandemic were a part of this. We were separated so much, but I also understand that this is part of late-stage dementia.  I don't want to understand, though.  I just want her to stay longer.  But if this is my last Christmas with her, I just can't fathom a world without my Mom in it.  I really can't.<br />
Any prayers will be appreciated.
