[A ship ran aground in the Suez Canal](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/middleeast/suez-canal-container-ship-intl-hnk/index.html), and it's brought shipping to a halt. <br />

I particularly enjoyed the Photoshopped “helpful” excavators, meme-transfereed to help the poor ship on Twitter.  Social media remains undefeated in calling-out the absurdity of a situation.
