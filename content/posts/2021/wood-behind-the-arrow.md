*Multitasking* is often glorified as the ultimate productivity "skill", but in reality it's just a low-value hack yielding slow (and often inaccurate) results.  Multitasking is a deceptive trap, because the human brain isn’t wired to focus on multiple complex tasks simultaneously. Instead, what we call “*multitasking*” is actually [**rapid task-switching**](https://www.apa.org/topics/research/multitasking?utm_source=chatgpt.com)—and it comes [**at a cost**](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2018/10/decade-data-reveals-heavy-multitaskers-reduced-memory-psychologist-says?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Each time you *shift focus*, your brain expends energy reorienting itself, [**leading to decreased efficiency**](https://www.verywellmind.com/multitasking-2795003?utm_source=chatgpt.com) and higher chances of mistakes or delays. <br />

Studies show that [multitasking can reduce productivity](https://www.verywellmind.com/multitasking-2795003?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (some show it reduces it by up to 40%!) and significantly impacts the quality of your work. It also increases stress and fosters a false sense of accomplishment, as we confuse "busy-ness" with effectiveness. The antidote? [***Single-tasking**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/organization/what-is-single-tasking-and-is-it-better-than-multi-tasking). Dedicate your attention to one task at a time, complete it well, and then move to the next. Not only will you finish faster, but the results will also reflect your full potential. <br />

There's a phrase I like to use for helping teams eliminate the *fractured focus*, and lost productivity, from multitasking: "***Wood behind the Arrow***".  It comes from wording [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) and Sun Microsystems CEO [Scott McNealy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy) used a lot in the 90s:

>"Put all your wood behind one arrowhead."

The idea expressed here is, *diffusion of effort* means no single strand of activity gets fully realized: **so no arrow hits its target**.  "*Multitasking*" is nothing short of a diffusion of your efforts.  <br />

Of course the phrase "the *un-aimed* arrow never misses" also comes to mind here, too; however, your team (or personal goals) already have an aim (hopefully): something you're trying to accomplish, your main priority or north star.  "*Multitasking*" can ruin that!  So, we *must aim* (prioritize) and bring intentional focus (eliminate multitasking wherever practical) to our goals. <br />

Another variation I saw on this phrase, recently was:

> "Experienced hunters bring only one arrow. They know how to aim (and they take plenty of time, when aiming), and they put *all the wood* behind that one arrow."

This is why we establish an *intentional backlog* in Agile and other project methodologies, and why your own personal productivity benefits from prioritizing: you can't do it ***all***, and so getting good at *aiming* (choosing one key *thing to finish* at-a-time, prioritizing tasks) allows you to put each task behind a single deliverable, or "*thing done*" (arrow!).  This ultimately increases your effictiveness and productivity, reduces your stress, and increases your sense of accomplishment. <br />

And remember: when you're knocking things out *one-at-a-time* rapidly --- **people on the outside only see "*multitasking*", anyway**! <br />

Happy (single)Tasking!!
