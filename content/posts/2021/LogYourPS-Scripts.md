We're automating so much these days, post-Covid.  It's how we survived, and thrived, as the small IT shop we are. <br />

Automation scripting is a cornerstone of effective IT systems management. Whether youâ€™re applying bulk config changes, querying status or config values across your environment, or simply experimenting with new cmdlets, proper logging ensures that you have a clear record of what happene and when it happened.  Logging is learning.  Logging is life. ðŸ˜‰ <br />

One challenge my team experienced was seeing what their scripts were <i>doing</i>. I was surprised at how none of my colleages' scripts were creating any logging data.  So I threw this together a primer to help them out, and decided to also post this info here. <br />

PowerShell makes it straightforward to keep track of your work by leveraging built-in transcript capabilities and custom logging functions. In this post I will briefly review how to use PowerShellâ€™s <span class="mono">Start-Transcript</span> feature to capture entire console sessions, and then weâ€™ll explore a custom <b>WriteLog</b> function to document scripted processes more granularly. Here we go!<br />

## Why Log?

Before diving into code, itâ€™s worth understanding the importance of logging. Logging provides:<br />
	â€¢	Traceability: Know exactly which commands were executed and when.<br />
	â€¢	Accountability: Provide an audit trail for compliance and troubleshooting.<br />
	â€¢	Debugging Aid: Easily identify what went wrong when a script doesnâ€™t behave as expected.<br />
	â€¢	Documenting Changes: Keep a historical record of environment modifications for reference. <br />

Especially in enterprise environments, maintaining robust logs can save countless hours of guesswork and improve your operational integrity.

## Primer on Start-Transcript

PowerShellâ€™s built-in Start-Transcript and Stop-Transcript cmdlets offer a simple way to record everything that happens in the console. When you run Start-Transcript, PowerShell begins capturing all input and output during your session. When youâ€™re done, Stop-Transcript finalizes the logging and saves the output to the file you specified.<br />

<b>Example</b>: <br />

~~~
# Start transcript with a specified output file
Start-Transcript -Path "C:\Logs\MyPSSession.log"

\# ... run various commands here ...

Stop-Transcript
~~~

Once stopped, you have a neat record of every command entered and response returned during that session. This approach is perfect for one-off sessions or documenting the execution of a large script that you run interactively. <br />

___However___, when creating highly automated, unattended scripts, you may want more structured control over what gets logged. Thatâ€™s where a custom logging function can be invaluable.<br />

~~~
Function WriteLog($LogString) {
    ##########################################################################
    ## Writes a timestamped entry to a log file defined by $LogFile variable
    ##########################################################################

    $Stamp = (Get-Date).ToString("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss")
    $LogMessage = "$Stamp $LogString"
    Add-Content $LogFile -Value $LogMessage
}
~~~

**How It Works**: <br />

1.  Timestamping: The function prefixes each message with a date/time stamp for clear sequencing.<br />
2.  Custom Messages: You have fine control over what gets logged. You can log progress, error messages, or summary statements at key points.<br />
3.  Predefined Log File Variable: By setting $LogFile before you call WriteLog, you control the output location without modifying the function itself each time.

**Example Usage**: <br />

~~~
# Define where you want your log
$LogFile = "C:\Logs\MyScriptActions.log"

WriteLog "Starting configuration tasks..."
\# Run some complex script actions here
WriteLog "Configuration tasks completed successfully."
~~~

When you inspect MyScriptActions.log, youâ€™ll see entries like: <br />

~~~
2024/12/09 09:15:00 Starting configuration tasks...
2024/12/09 09:16:10 Configuration tasks completed successfully. 
~~~

This selective approach to logging is particularly useful in automation scripts, where every executed step can be logged methodically. <br />

## Best Practices for Logging in Your Scripts

1. Use Consistent, Centralized Logs:<br />
Keep logs in a known, consistent directory structure. Consider naming logs by date or by the script that generated them for quick reference.<br />
2. Log Important Steps and Results:<br />
Donâ€™t flood your logs with every tiny detailâ€”log the big steps, decision points, errors, and completion states. Your logs should tell a story of what your script did, not overwhelm you with noise.<br />
3. Secure Your Logs:<br />
Logs can contain sensitive information. Ensure that the directories storing them have appropriate file system permissions. In some cases, consider encrypting or obfuscating sensitive data.<br />
4. Periodically Review and Rotate Logs:<br />
Large logs become unmanageable. Consider archiving old logs and rotating them monthly or after a certain size threshold.<br />

## Putting It All Together

A robust logging approach might look like this:<br /><br />
	1.	Begin Transcript for Full Visibility:<br />
Use <span class="mono">Start-Transcript</span> at the start of an interactive session or a run-once script to capture a full record.<br />
	2.	Use WriteLog in Your Script Logic:<br />
Throughout your script, insert calls to WriteLog to highlight key steps, confirm registry values read, and record errors or decisions.<br />
	3.	Stop Transcript at the End (If Applicable):<br />
When the script is done, run <span class="mono">Stop-Transcript</span> to finalize your console-based logging.<br />

By combining these techniques, you get both broad-stroke session logging and fine-grained, contextual logging of critical actions. Whether youâ€™re troubleshooting an issue or proving compliance with your organizationâ€™s policies, these logs become invaluable assets.<br />

Effective logging is a fundamental practice for anyone running scripts in a production environment. With PowerShellâ€™s native transcript tools and the flexible WriteLog function I share above, you can create robust and meaningful logs that help you maintain control, compliance, and peace of mind in your automated operations.
