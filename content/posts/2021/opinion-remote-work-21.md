Before this shift toward remote work, I used to start my days by battling a 45 to 60 minute commute, each way, for a total of 1.5 to 2-hours total drive time.  And I only live 14 miles away from work.  Navigating congested highways and unpredictable traffic is . By the time I arrived at the office, I was already tired and, frankly, less focused than I wanted to be. Since we’ve implemented more flexible remote policies, that stress has all but disappeared. I begin each day refreshed, working in a quiet environment that allows me to tackle architecture design projects, deployments, and solution-testing with renewed clarity. <br />

What surprised me most was how much more time I’ve gained—time I now spend refining complex infrastructure plans, rather than sitting in a car. I can quickly hop on a video call with my team, troubleshoot configuration issues, or integrate new technologies into our environment without the distractions of office hustle and bustle. My productivity and morale have soared, and becuase (right now, anyway) my employer values results over physical presence, I’m more engaged in my work and feel trusted as a professional. As a result, I’m delivering better designs, faster turnaround times, and more thoughtful input on strategic initiatives.<br />

When I do visit the office on those select days—usually for critical hardware installations or major rollout events—I’m not burnt out when I arrive. Instead, I’m focused and prepared, making those on-site hours far more productive than they were before. Remote work hasn’t just changed where I do my job; it’s fundamentally improved <i>how well</i> I do it, and that’s made all the difference.<br />

My advice to companies with tech staff experiencing similar productivity curve while working remotely the past year: <br />

<b>Focus on <i>outcomes</i> & accountability, <i>NOT OFFICE BADGE SWIPES</i></b>.
