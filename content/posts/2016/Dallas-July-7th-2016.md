My city is in shock. 5 Officers dead and 11 people wounded.<br />

On Thursday we had a peaceful march by Black Lives Matter and other groups, just a regular peaceful gathering to protest the recent high-profile police brutality cases around the country. It was a remarkable event long before any shots rang out: our police welcomed them to march, protected the protestors, and there was repeated scenes of police speaking with many of the protestors.  Clearly in an effort to try and get more understanding and maybe foster some healing. Our city’s police department was already among the best in the nation, this way, big into community policing and trying to not have all DPD police living in faraway suburbs.  Towards the end of the march, before the brutal shots rang out, you could see many protestors and police marching together.<br />

And then this madman Xavier Johnson happened. He is dead, and leaves behind shattered lives and families.<br />

I don’t know what else to say except that Dallas has to once-again be a site of a horrific day in history. If you’re the praying type, my city needs it.
