Although the Star Wars prequels were among the least-enjoyed among Gen-X and older fans, there is this fantastic Zen observation in Episode I which few people notice. Putting aside the poorly-scripted dialog & Jar-Jar scenes, there is a part I enjoy where Yoda discusses fear and attachment and hints at a fundamentally powerful way to be in life.<br /> <br />

It’s that scene where Yoda asks Anakin how he feels. He observes Anakin’s fears about losing his mother, and Anakin asks what fear has to do with anything — to which Yoda answers:<br /> <br />

>“Everything! Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to <i>anger</i>. Anger leads to <i>hate</i>. Hate leads to <i>suffering</i>.”<br /> <br />

Yoda’s dimestore-buddhism actually offers huge insights into how we experience attachment, loss, and how we fear loss in general. We all know (or <i>should</i> know) that constantly fearing loss can ruin your life. And while you may not turn into Darth Vader, it’s no way to live. Living in fear of losing something or someone will turn you into one of those glass-half-empty cynical a**holes who only see negative. It’s a dark way to experience your life, a darker side of things if you will (pun). It seems obvious fear of loss makes you anxious and angry, but indulge me here, brave Star Wars fan.<br /> <br />

In my teen years and beyond, I struggled internally with my mother’s decisions and the evolving state of her health. So I would try to get my mom to stop smoking or eat better, because I feared she would get cancer or die early like my father did in his 40s. So I tried many, many, times to help Mom just transform into this healthy person that she “should be”.<br /> <br />

And of course I never got her to stop smoking, or make all the other life changes I thought she was supposed to make. I wanted to control something that scared me (losing my mom to lung cancer), but I eventually realized that my need to control things and being attached to this fear of possible loss was a direct path to frustration, anger…all those things Yoda goes on about. It’s an important distinction many people fail to make. <b>You are not in control of the universe and, in realizing or truly accepting this, you can actually change your experience of life.</b><br /> <br />

Once I stopped trying to control mom’s health situation, stopped trying to change her, I began to accept her for who she is without reservation or judgement. And who is she? My mom is this cool person who is hilarious, happy, and doesn’t worry about things. I enjoy that she laughs about everything and is this glass-half-full lady who (despite her own losses in her life) is all about living life in the moment. She’s loud (sometimes maybe too loud), talks a lot, and wants you to know about a good movie on TCM. She lives simply, and she has a simple and effictive life-philosophy that I understood and respected once I actually took the time to really listen and look.<br /> <br />

Only when I started enjoying my mother’s presence, instead of worrying about losing her to smoking and trying to control it, did I realize all of these great things about her. And you know what? Flash-forward 20+ years and now my mother is 83 years old. I’m 40, and our relationship is pretty good. Her health is in decline these days, but I don’t live in fear of losing my mom and I enjoy the time we have. Because of this, we have had some great moments I otherwise would have missed…and memories to look back on.<br /> <br />

I am learning that accepting and experiencing people for <i>who they are</i>, without trying to change or fix them, is the best way to get through this life. But practicing this isn’t always easy: when my friend Ben was seriously ill, there was the normal fear and anger you would expect. Fear of losing a friend, and anger that Doctors aren’t perfect led me to second-guessing every decision made to try and save him. The longer I tried to control things I had no control over, the more angry I became (very easy for me to do). There truly was little <i>I</i> could bring up that hadn’t already been tried by Ben’s doctors, and after Ben tragically passed my anger remained.<br /> <br />

I had hateful and cynical moments in the weeks and months after this, and I didn’t believe what doctors said about much of anything for years. I withheld my trust and extended only extended fear and cynicism to others. The longer I operated this way, the less secure and more distrustful I became of pretty much everything. I forgot <b>trust is an act, of you granting it.</b>  Even while it's granted, not necessarilly earned, past trauma makes you distrustful anyway. I eventually re-learned that being a fearful and angry person in the world doesn’t help you all that much. In fact it does exactly the opposite and hurts you in the long run, just as it surely hurts people in your life as well.<br /> <br />

All we can do is try to not run through the door that “constant fear of loss” opens wide for us. Whether we learn it from a Zen Master or a flawed George Lucas movie, fear really does lead to anger and suffering.<br /> <br />

<i>Correct</i>, Yoda was.<br /> <br />

<div style="font-size: 8px;">Constant fear leads you to anger. Being a fearful angry person leads you to hate. Being hateful leads you to suffer.
