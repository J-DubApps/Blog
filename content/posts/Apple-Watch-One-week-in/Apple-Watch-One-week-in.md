I am a watch guy. Whatever I’ve done in my crazy life I almost always would be wearing some kind of timepiece. I am unashamed to say I wore a Casio calculator watch in the 80s way, way past when it stopped being cool. If it ever was. This is quite a bit different than that, yet also <a href="http://www.noodlewerk.com/blog/calculator-apple-watch-tutorial/">similar.</a><br />

Until this past week I had been wearing a <a href="http://www.watch-id.com/sightings/timex-ironman-dual-tech-will-ferrell-stranger-fiction">Timex Iron Man</a>, because being an out-of-shape nerd with an athelete’s watch is just how I roll. Apple Watch can do stopwatch and all the other functions that my Timex does. Plus I can now track my heart-rate while thinking about exercising, too.<br />

When I opened the Apple Watch, configured it, and slapped it on I immediately could tell this could be a hit with people like me who hate phone-notifications. I keep my notifications all on silent, except for the “VIP” group feature that was introduced in iOS 7. Senders in that group (friends, family, etc) will make a noise or otherwise indicate new mail or text, while the rest of filthy humanity has to wait until I review my mail (exception: work mail, I’m probably glancing at that inbox every half hour or so).<br />

The Apple Watch can take all those silent notifications, if properly configured, and allow you to review and clear them them with a simple “force touch”. The watch is otherwise chatty out of the box, with quite a few notifications enabled by default. Once you turn all that junk off, and configure the alerts with intent (which ones are important, which aren’t) the watch is a lot more useful.<br />

I’m not seeing the problem with battery-life all the tech bloggers are concerned about, but I know this probably won’t make it 2 whole days before going into “Power Reserve” mode either. I didn’t think I would like it, but the screen does look good and cleaner than I thought it would. And I also like the overall look of the case. I usually prefer a round watch case, but this form-factor just makes sense to me the more I use it. So I really think Mr Ive & designers got it right.<br />

I haven’t really done much else with the watch yet, so this isn’t really any kind of review. Just a first-impression after a week. But I have connected it to my Phillips Hue plain lights around the house. Kind of fun to control the lights from your wrist.<br />

My only complaint, so far, is that there aren’t enough watch faces. The stock ones from Apple are really great-looking, so it’s easy to overlook this. But if Apple <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/04/custom_watch_faces">isn’t allowing third-party watch faces</a> then I am hoping they come up with some more variety or offer more customization options. But all-in-all I like it so far, and I think it will be my main watch and notifications-gateway for some time to come.<br />
