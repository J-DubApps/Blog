<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/14/dallas-storm-2012_n_1596231.html">I believe it.</a> I got trapped in this at rush-hour yesterday on Central Expressway.<br />

My car’s roof is a cratered moonscape, but I’m lucky. Several cars near me were worse-off with blasted windshields and even a bloody driver near Northpark and Central. Never witnessed hail like that in my life. Off to file the insurance claim. I guess my Chevy Volt plans will have to wait.<br />
