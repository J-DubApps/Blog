It has been a difficult Thanksgiving. Ill family members, separations, it hasn’t been easy. But my Mom continues to improve and is about to move out of the Rehab into her permanent residence. The private residence part is where things got really difficult this week.<br />

Although Mom is more mobile now, and has more energy, she must stay in a wheelchair. And this may be permanent. She is still not steady enough to use a walker or other assistive device. Because of the wheelchair and strength/coordination issues, she cannot move into the Assisted-Living wing of the community she has been in.<br />

I spent 2 and a half weeks furnishing and preparing an apartment in the Assisted-Living wing for my Mom, and she is will be unable to see it. What’s so hard is that I showed her the apartment, and now we must cancel the lease and move the furniture out, as her skilled-nursing residence is already furnished and is smaller and more medical.<br />

But this is where we are. Mom simply wouldn’t be safe in the Assisted-Living wing, where you must be mobile enough to where you could reach a buzzer for the on-staff person to help. This person isn’t a skilled-nurse usually, but more of a nurse’s aid who helps you with medicine schedules etc. Mom cannot even go to the bathroom fully alone, at least not where she would be safe.<br />

So, on the day before Thanksgiving, the Doctors and staff met with me and advised that Mom would be much safer staying in skill-nursing and being a permanent resident in that wing, where there is 24/7 care. She just doesn’t qualify for Assisted-Living basic requirements, and there isn’t much I could do with my home to duplicate or extend the nursing needs she has.<br />

I can’t express how this development broke my heart. Mom had me in her 40s, and I always knew this day may come earlier for me than it has for most of my friends. But I still never knew WHAT things would happen, or in what order, or what decisions I would have to make. I want her to just live with me, but I can’t put 24/7 care in our home. I just don’t have the money or setup in our house to realistically serve my mother’s increasing needs. This has all been foreign, and painful, but it’s where we are. After Mom’s falls this year and recovery from her recent hospitalization, we’re down to one concern: <b>safety</b>. She just needs to be safe.<br />

Safe and loved.
