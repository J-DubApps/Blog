So I’ve been running the Insider Preview since February and, although OSX is my jam, I am impressed. It addresses most of the gripes that I had with Windows 8, and I think it will be a hit for Microsoft. Windows pays the bills in corporate IT, so I keep a Windows VM as a daily-driver and so far I haven’t had one single blue screen of death (or whatever color it is now) and I find this version to be rock-solid.<br />

Windows 10 is a free upgrade to Windows 7 & 8 users (don’t ask what happened to Windows 9) and things don’t get much better than free these days. Fire up your Windows Updates app to go check it out.<br />
