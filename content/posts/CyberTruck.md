No thanks, Elmo.<br />

A lot of water has passed under the bridge since I first reserved it, and while most of us old ancient early Tesla investors and early customers have been disappointed by past & recent behavior of the CEO, my main reason have a lot to do with the CyberTrucks I have experienced in person.  I test-driove a friend's CT, rode in a couple of others, and I have to say it just wasn't for me.  Tesla is also having some birthing issues with this first year CT, as well, but overall I just can't get into the truck.  If I'm being honest, I wasn't really ever into it when they unveiled it. If I do ever end up rolling an EV truck, it would probably be a Rivian or Ford F-150 Lightning.  But to each their own.  Peace!
