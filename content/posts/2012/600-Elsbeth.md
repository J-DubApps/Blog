My mom grew up on Elsbeth street just 2 blocks down from 600 Elsbeth, where Lee Harvey Oswald resided in ’62 and part of ’63. She was 32 and living in Irving by then, and it was only later when she realized her parents lived near where LHO did. More irony: just prior to the assassination Oswald’s wife (and sometimes him, too) lived just 1 block over from my mom & dad’s house in Irving on W. 5th street. This was a a full 10 years before I was born. Very sad <a href="http://cityhallblog.dallasnews.com/2013/01/breaking-city-of-dallas-to-raze-600-elsbeth-this-week-ending-years-of-fighting-over-old-oswald-apartment.html/">another piece of Dallas history is going away</a>. Again.
