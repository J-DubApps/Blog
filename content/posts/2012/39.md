As of Tuesday, September 4th, 2012….I am officially….pushing…40.><br />

Wow.<br />

Whether I was 10 or 20, I could never imagine reaching this age. At all. But it happened, and now here I am. 14235 days, which seems like an eon, and I’m still alive. Some days even thriving. But man: 39. It doesn’t feel real, and the concept seems so…OLD!<br />

Now if you’ll excuse me, I have kids to tell about getting off my lawn.<br />
