Everybody is nuts about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk">Standing desks</a> the last few years.<br />

I thought I would be too. As it turns out, not so much. Not until I added a little something, and then it was frickin’ awesome..<br />

After my employer let me have one at my workstation, I found standing over time didn’t quite give me all the benefits everyone was raving about. Even with having the freedom to switch between my geeky <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Aeron-Chairs">Aeron chair</a> and my feet, I would end up having new little pains here and there. And it wasn’t all due to my near middle-aged frame. Something was missing..<br />

Moving. That’s what was missing, y’see..<br />

So I read up on <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1156988/treadmilldesk.html">Treadmill desks</a> and found that there exists a DIY cult dedicated to this kind of thing. I loved the idea. So I grabbed my oh-so-dusty underutilized treadmill and moved it to my home-office (facing my backyard window). Then I found an IKEA standing desk furniture on Craigslist. Yes, IKEA: <a href="http://www.ikeahackers.net/">the DIY furniture stand-by</a>.<br />

Voila. The benefits of standing AND moving:<br />
