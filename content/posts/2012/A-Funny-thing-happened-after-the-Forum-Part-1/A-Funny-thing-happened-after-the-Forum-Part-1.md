<small><small><small>CORRECTION: I recently found documentation indicating I attended my Forum seminar a few months later than my recollection: making it technically 1995—I conflated the <i>Tuesday Night Intro Session</i> in late 1994 with my actual Forum, which occurred a few months later. Thus the year correction in my articles. </small></small></small>

</div> <br />

<i>This is from a 3-part mini-memoir about my brief experience with <b>The Landmark Forum</b>, which was published on my old blog in March 2009. It received tens of thousands of views and I still recieve feedback about it…</i><br />

In 1995 I became one of millions who graduated <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Forum">The Landmark Forum</a></b> …<br />

It’s not really something anybody usually crows about: attending a seminar about self-improvement, empowerment, etc.  And **Landmark Education** is *controversial* in some circles and media. So **Landmark** is not anything I have ever spoken with anyone about, until *recently*-—and after some distance (*and* I was looking for ideas for new blog content). When you *do* speak about "***The Landmark Forum***" to somebody, the person might look at you as if you lost your mind or joined a cult (stay with me until *Part 3* where I land on that whole *cult* thing). <br />

To most people, personal-growth seminars like **The Landmark Forum** are just these cheesy self-help groups that some people laugh at, while others swear-by. Yet somehow, through chance, I ended up attending the main 3-day (plus one evening) **Landmark Forum** course.  This was due, in part, to a pushy company initiative-and my own youthful curiosity in 1995. And *from this distance* (a decade and a half now), I wanted to share my experiences that I noted in my journal back then.  No, they didn't "*brainwash*" or mess me up, and while I have my criticisms...later on I'll get into *what I liked* and found useful and learned from attending *The Forum*. <br />

The most fascinating thing, to this day, is I am *still* familiar with most of their core terms and concepts (their "*lingo*", or "***technology***"—as they call it).  If you Google *Landmark Forum* and [Landmark Worldwide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Education) you will find the usual [*LGAT*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-group_awareness_training) critcisms, or even see it likened to *a cult* by some people. Equally represented seems to be people citing ***The Landmark Forum*** as a *positive* experience with powerful (even *life-changing*) insights. I fall somewhere *in the middle*: I’m no apologist, cheerleader, or paid shill for **Landmark**...and I feel this lets me to offer an unbiased assessment and review.  I do offer some criticisms; *however*, I *can* tell you here and now that I believe **Landmark** is ***not*** by any stretch a religion or cult. A Multi-Level Marketing group? Maybe, but I didn't see or hear about any pyramid schemes on selling seats to the Forum.  But those final evening sessions were a hard sell.  It felt that way in 1995, anyway, but no way can I see the [*cult*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult) label stick. Your mileage may vary, and I have no interest in debating it, but I *will say* that **The Landmark Forum** is definitely ***NOT*** for *everyone*. In fact, I would say **The Forum** is *most beneficial* for specific types of people and personalities. The Landmark Forum ***Leader*** during the 3-day weekend course even says as much, in the first few minutes on the first day.  More on *that* in a bit when I progress through my brief retelling of my experience in the weekend seminar itself.<br />

I’ve had so many years to reflect, and educate myself on the original Eastern/Western philosophies that inform *The Landmark Forum* (and its progenitor [***est***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training)), that I decided to write about my own Landmark Forum experience from this distance. From my current perspective, I can detail how *I experienced* this <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Potential_Movement">Human Potential Movement</a></b> seminar, and also convey to you an somewhat unbiased understanding of what exactly *The Forum* is about.<br />

If you are not familiar with <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-group_awareness_training">Large Group-Awareness Training</a></b> methods (or LGATs, if you like your NLP groups in shorthand), they are essentially mass-marathon training sessions that usually employ either some kind of specific knowledge or reasoning, to help you achieve some result (e.g. "*transformation*" etc). You may see similarities between the Forum and <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_McGraw">Dr Phil</a></b> or <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Robbins">Tony Robbins</a></b> (Dr Phil actually went through early est training: the precursor to the Forum). For my experience, the Forum is probably the *least-discussed* of all of the awareness training systems out there, yet it’s a big organization. Unlike Lifespring or other new-age style LGATs, **Landmark** doesn’t have a charismatic leader at the top (at least not *anymore*, so *read on* for details that I get into, about their est founder), and it gets no publicity through traditional methods or marketing. The Landmark Forum is advertised almost *entirely* by word-of-mouth. <br />

**In covering the Landmark Forum in *3* parts over the next two days**, I want to discuss some of the specific *Forum tenets* that I actually *still use* in my professional career, and the aspects I rejected or *don't* use. I hope to give you an even-handed review, and my aim is *not* to please Forum critics nor Forum evangelists alike.  If I succeed in that then, if nothing else...if you're considering the Forum—perhaps these articles can be helpful in your own research.
 
### My “story”

Over 15 years ago the owner of the company I worked for asked employees to attend **The Forum** *tuition-free* on his dime.  He had recently taken the seminar, and was full of energy and excitement for how it could help his employees and his company.  So my Forum experience started like most: at one of the infamous “Tuesday night ceremonies” that happen at *the end* of someone else's graduation from the Forum.  It was there that I found myself, and several co-workers, experiencing people excited about their *breakthroughs*, hearing some testimonies of enthusiastic recent Forum grads—some who even said they were *transformed* (as if they were a *new person*).  It was also here where we got the infamous “hard sell” sign-up pitch—as a choice for ourselves, and for possibility, etc.  To this day, my biggest criticism of Landmark are the sales-aspects attached to those “Tuesday Night” Grad-sessions. I will discuss that toward the end of these posts—in Part 3.<br />

So our Tuesday night Intro Session was full of lively and excited people, all discussing their new insights and discoveries gained from attending, and I can't say it *didn't* intrigue me a little.  In fact, it *did*. Some of the benefits detailed to us (should we "*make a choice*" to *reigster* and sign-up) were quite interesting. The main theme, toward the end, was: we were to sign-up of our own volition, of course.  Not because of our generous CEO offered to pay for us, or was practically begging us to go—not because of the euphoric Forum grads, either. No—signing up for **The Forum** was, as they told us, a our own *choice* and a “***commitment to ourselves***”—to obtain new insights on *being an effective person*, more self-expressive, more balanced, etc. That pitch did sound a little weird and *self-helpy*, sure, but this was the first of several exercises **The Forum** undertakes once you sign-up anyway.  In a way, you're already getting a *little* of the Forum training just in that pitch they make.  Before I get to the *actual course*, and how I decided to attend: let me stop and spend a minute on ***The Landmark Forum's*** **history**. 

### History of the Landmark Forum

Like anything new involving a group, I followed my own individualistic skepticism gave a firm “no” to signing on to attend or participate. Over the next few days that became a qualified “no”...which in the end became a tentative “yes” after prodding from my boss and CEO. Such was the convincing nature of our CEO Jerry Federico. Jerry could sell ice to Eskimos, and he made a *powerful* case for the Landmark Forum. I told him he would get my answer after I had time to hit the public library and read up on them. Yes this was 1995 and there was no real public Internet or Wikipedia: you had Microfiche and magazine archive CDs with “search engines” at the library back in the day. Good times. I miss them, actually.<br />

In researching *The Forum* I found that Landmark Education is the culmination of former participants and employees of [***Werner Erhard’s***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Erhard) “***Forum***”, a program which he originally created in the 1970s under its first name, ***est***”. I had heard of est before, and Erhard (originally John Paul Rosenberg) was a controversial figure who administered est with a zeal and harshness that is mostly absent from the modern Forum. Erhard created a huge self-help meme that stands to this day: if you have ever see the 1977 movie “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078227/">Semi-Tough</a>”, Bert Convy’s caricature of est and Werner Erhard are a mirror of how America views self-help movements in general, and Erhard in particular. 2008’s “<b><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/">Yes Man</a></b>” has Terrence Stamp’s “Yes” guru evoking Erhard. And you can see some of Erhard’s directness in the live dialogs of other LGAT rockstars like Tony Robbins.<br />

Throughout the 1970s and 80s people flocked to Werner Erhard’s est training. Yoko Ono, John Denver, and yes even Dr. Phil McGraw attended est seminars. To this day est and Forum grads recognize McGraw’s use of more polite est/Forum techniques on TV. For better or worse, Dr. Phil and other self-help personalities owe much of their success to Erhard and est.<br />

Plagued with controversies and tax issues into the late 80s, Erhard/Rosenberg retired from public life and sold the Forum to his employees and est graduates who were led by his brother Harry Rosenberg. From that purchase they established Landmark Education Corporation and the original “Forum/est” publicly faded away. The Forum remains probably the largest and most successful personal-growth workshop to come from the Human Potential Movements of the 70s.<br />

### Deciding to go… <br />

The more I learned about Erhard and est and the media coverage, the less interested I became. On the surface it reminded me of Scientology; however, I later learned Scientology is actually a big enemy of Erhard and Landmark Education—with L. Ron Hubbard claiming that Erhard stole concepts and ideas of his, and re-branded them. When you make an enemy of an entity like Scientology, maybe you are doing something right *after all*. Or, worse, you’re doing something wrong!<br />

I decided I would decline our CEO’s offer for the all-expenses-paid journey. Of course Jerry’s ice-Eskimo sales capabilities were in full play, and he urged me to consider going at least the first day. He told me the Forum was not like est or Scientology and, if after going one day I still I didn’t like it, I could walk away. So he was willing to front the $500 admission price and essentially toss some vacation days at me for giving up a Friday. Though I was still dubious, in my 20s I was also a little bit wreckless and curious. I wasn't about to pass on future days off, for going to some dog & pony show that I could quit. So I gave him the Friday commitment, pretty much deciding I would see some weird happenings, be offered enlightenment...and just leave after a couple hours. I ended up staying the *entire 3 days*.<br />

Later I would come to find Jerry "*knew*" and felt so confident that I would attend the *whole* Forum seminar, that he had already pre-registered me with several other employees who were going *anyway*.  Fun guy, that Jerry. I think he was probably the most driven person I ever worked for. <br /> 

So I arrived at the conference facilities of a nondescript hotel in a Houston suburb on the following Friday with several co-workers. I didn’t see any robes, symbols, or magical religious trickery.  No Scientology “e-meter” or cult stuff. Just well-groomed volunteers in slacks and sweaters. From briefly talking to our group felt fairly assured that, if the Forum was a cult, it certainly *didn’t have the trappings* of one. We would find, later at the end, the “marketing” of the Forum during the "Tuesday night session" is what really gave it that culty-taste for a hot-minute.<br />

Within about 30 minutes a relaxed individual came forward and introduced himself to us. This person was going to be our “Forum Leader” during of the seminar, and he began explaining the ground rules and what we would get out of the next 3 days.  But, first: he separated us.  No sitting next to people you work with, or knew. That would help you get the training better.  It made sense, but I still ended up sitting next to a friend from work, anyway! <br />

### Nuts & Bolts: *How* the Forum *Works*

**The Landmark Forum is, *simply put*, an ongoing 3-day *rigorous* conversation**.  It is facillitated with a 75–250 person group, and is then followed by a final Tuesday weeknight "*graduation session*". It gets *intensely philosophical*, *dialogic*, and incurs a *deep inquiry* of questions that have been of interest to human beings for eons. The Forum usually takes place in or near a hotel meeting facility because of the long hours, which are usually 9AM until about 11PM at night—but can go even *longer* into the next morning. Even with short breaks about every 2 or 3 hours (and afternoon/early evening meal breaks) the pace is constant and you *will* lose all track of time. You basically go from what was a 9–11 hour grind right to your hotel room (or back home, if you live nearby), and you are physically and mentally tired and *spent*. Then you start *right up* the next day because the rhythm they set is pretty focused each day. <br />

The Forum basically espouses a “*Technology*”, or knowledge, that can be applied to daily living. This “technology” pulls together practical concepts offered by various philosophers like Socrates, Sartre, and Heidegger (there’s a metric ton of Heidegger in the Forum). When we think of "technology" our minds go to computers or something *mechanical*; but with The Forum’s “technology”, their *technological* angle is the “*application of a specific knowledge*”.<br />

The Forum applies systems of thought to conversations in the form of exercises.  These exercises involve cognitive psychological concepts like the [Johari Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johari_window), to identify what Landmark calls “***Blind Spots***”. Essentially a good amount of what might feel like neuro-linguistic programming, but I would disagree. Lingual conditioning, maybe, but I never felt like I was being “programmed” or hypnotized. Quite the opposite in most instances. While there is an existential angle people attach to it, the Forum makes it fairly clear the first day that they are not out to explain "*the meaning of life*" or give out some “ultimate truth”. That’s on *you* to figure out. Instead, the Forum concepts are basically just practical common-sense ideas delivered with a lightly-shocking intensity.<br />

The Forum seems to be concerned with helping already-effective, usually successful, people-and help those people make specific distinctions about goals and happiness. One distinction is: seeking happiness in the future after meeting a goal creates a cycle where, after the goalposts get moved, “happiness” gets put off or “*re-defined*”. The Forum believes that this constant struggle to be happier stops us from being happy and at peace ***right now*** in the present. It’s such a reasonable and basic idea, when you hear it, that the concept of learning to live in the moment seems too obvious to be something that must be taught. But as anyone who has read Eckhart Tolle will tell you, the present moment is one of the hardest places to ***be***.  And it's one of the chief concerns of self-help systems like the Forum.<br />

So The Landmark Forum uses a specific set of terms and knowledge, or “*technology*” as they call it, culled from various sources to compile a *possible way of* “*being*”. This way of being can stop the above cycle and help people live in the present with authenticity. And living in the present, according to The Landmark Forum (and Buddha and many others), allows you to be satisfied and more effective (maybe even more fulfilled) in the matter of your daily life. Who can argue with *that*? Still, this aim usually incurs harsh judgment from some independent-minded people as well as critics of LGATs and Human Potential Movement organizations: they’re "*selling* how to live in the moment?!" Not being a self-help expert, I can’t tell you if the Forum is *good* at teaching this; however, I *can* tell you that I got my own appreciation for how people let their *past* affect their *present* (and, thus, their *future*).  The concepts the Forum discusses are almost universal and of interest to most *any* human being. What the Forum tries to accomplish is connecting people with the *present* and "***what's so***" in a very visceral way. More on just how the Forum labors to achieve this result tomorrow, in Part 2.<br />
