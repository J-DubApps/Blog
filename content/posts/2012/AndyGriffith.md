Just heard news today that my favorite Sheriff has passed. I was a big fan.<br />

Worth noting is Andy Griffith’s most amazing performance in <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/07/03/andy_griffith_dead_at_86_before_andy_taylor_and_matlock_there_was_a_face_in_the_crowd_.html">A Face In The Crowd</a>. It’s just a shockingly well-acted role I would put up against DeNiro or Brando any day. Every movie critic and movie fan are sure to re-discover it this summer.<br />
