…saw this linked today on the Simplicity Is Bliss blog and it’s making the rounds, for obvious reasons, with various Knowledge Worker sites:<br /><br />

>Dear [Insert name]<br />

>Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend this meeting.<br />

>As someone who is paid to create value for this organization, I feel it is my ethical obligation to decline participating in meetings that have neither (a) a stated purpose, nor (b) a clear agenda, as it is well documented and agreed upon by most leadership teams that the absence of this intentional thinking costs companies upwards of billions of dollars every year [insert link to most recent source]. If you wish for me to attend, please send a second invitation with this information clearly stated so I can accurately estimate the value of my attendance.
Sincerely,<br />

>[Insert name]<br /><br />
