Everything is entropy. Change is constant. And stagnation is bad. Since I do all of my current writing at julianwest.me, I’ve kind of left my decade old site Mydigitalpathos.com alone. It's overkill to author two blogs at the same time and expect any quality in the content, so I decided to retire Mydigitalpathos.com and keep going over here. It had a great run, but julianwest.me is fresh-start and I wanna keep it going.<br />

As a fond-farewell to my old blog of over a decade, I will be re-posting content from Mydigitalpathos.com over here for the next month or two. I’m only going to focus on podcast episodes or articles that had the most-hits/comments.  I’ll start with personal posts on my experience with a well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-group_awareness_training">LGAT</a>. They were probably the longest and most-viewed posts I ever made on these Internets.<br />

Anyway, farewell Mydgitialpathos…and thank you for following me over to blog.julianwest.me, where it’s all about .me now.<br />
Julian<br /><br />
