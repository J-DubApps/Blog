For better or worse (and a few people who know me would say “worse”), I’ve always been a sucker for <a href="http://www.travelingwilburys.com/">Traveling Wilbury/ELO</a> whiz <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/ladies-and-gentlemen-i-give-you-jeff-lynne/">Jeff Lynne</a>’s music. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20001102084127/http://jeff-lynne.org/">I even ran a Jeff Lynne fan site</a> many moons ago, which tracked his every move and had a discussion forum where people would endlessly talk and obsess about Mr Lynne.<br />

<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/premiere-jeff-lynne-covers-soul-nugget-mercy-mercy-20120921">His new music video</a> is awesome. A low-profile, terminally-shy personality clearly headed for the Rock Hall of Fame, Jeff is one of those “best-kept secrets” in pop/rock music.<br />

So check out <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/premiere-jeff-lynne-covers-soul-nugget-mercy-mercy-20120921">Mercy, Mercy</a> by “The Jeffs” and, if you like what you hear, grab his new album, out early next month. If you’re already a fan, <a href="http://www.elo.biz/news/89191">there’s a bonus ELO re-release</a> coming our way too.<br />
