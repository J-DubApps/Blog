***Those who *know*, don't *say*.  Those who *say*, don't *know*. <br />

The Chinese Lao Tzu first expressed this as: “**He who knows does not speak; he who speaks does not know**.” <br />

Remember this for LOUD voices/trolls owning our country's dialogue right now.  Remember this for Culture Warriors and those using levers of power: **true wisdom cannot always captured in words, and that those who speak too readily may lack deeper understanding**.
