•	Everyone is replaceable—don’t oversacrifice or exhaust yourself for any single job.<br />
•	Thoroughly document your work.<br />
•	If you're irreplaceable, you're *unpromotable*: refer to the previous two reminders.<br />
•	Keep a record of important emails (and interactions, when needed)—proof beats promises & hearsay.<br />
•	Free snacks or lunch is not a reward for your hard work, and usually unhealthy. Value yourself beyond that. <br />
•	Unashamedly use your PTO days, you’ve earned them.<br />
•	Family ultimately outranks any job.  *Always*.<br />
•	Never stay at one job longer than 4 years unless the pay increase is substantial.  <br />Once you've stayed twice that long, even if the money is still great...you have traded a significant portion of your value the job-market for comfort.  That's *ok*, but just understand that's what you're doing -- and continue to develop personally and professionally. <br />
•	Focus on *your own development* (see previous reminder), not just your job.  *Personal-development drive profesisonal performance*.  <br />
•	Prioritize self-care, put your needs first, and always stay a step ahead.<br />
•	***Never*** accept a promotion in name, if it doesn't include a bump in compensation.<br />
•	Keep personal details about your life under wraps.  Don't overshare. <br />
•	Familiarity breeds contempt: beware coworkers who want to know everything about you (see previous reminder).  Whether they're intending to or not, they may come to judge.
•	Be kind and don't ever judge others, resist the base human instinct: [everyone you know is fighting a battle you know nothing about.  Be kind. Always.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6697537-everyone-you-meet-is-fighting-a-battle-you-know-nothing)
•	HR is not there to protect *you*, they are there to protect the company.  They're almost-always good people, but their positions are by-design to serve & protect company interests.  <br /><br />

Here's to a great 2025!
