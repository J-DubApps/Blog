â€¢	Everyone is replaceableâ€”donâ€™t oversacrifice or exhaust yourself for any single job.<br />
â€¢	Thoroughly document your work.<br />
â€¢	If your skillset becomes *irreplaceable*, ***you*** become ***unpromotable***: refer to the previous two reminders.  Documenting and working out a cross-train approach ([read my post on that here](https://julianwest.me/Blog/empowering-independence-it/)) is key.<br />
â€¢	Keep a record of important emails (and interactions, when needed)â€”proof beats promises & hearsay.<br />
â€¢	Free snacks or lunch is not a reward for your hard work, and mostly unhealthy anyway. Value yourself beyond that. <br />
â€¢	Minimize "eating in your office" (see previous reminder) and take walks -- this goes the same for when remote-working. It's unavoidable that you need to eat there sometimes, but don't make it every day.
â€¢	Even if you're not that social, when on-prem officing *use the breakroom* at least once a day. It is an ecosystem of human dynamics that *must be navigated*.  If you are to work out your company culture: this is usually the court it's adjudicated in.  Trust me on this.
â€¢	Unashamedly use your PTO days, youâ€™ve earned them.<br />
â€¢	Family ultimately outranks any job.  *Always*.<br />
â€¢	Never stay at one job longer than 4 years unless the pay increase is substantial.  <br />Once you've stayed twice that long, even if the money is still great...you have traded a significant portion of your value the job-market for comfort.  **That's *ok*, but just understand that's what you're doing -- and continue to develop personally and professionally**. <br />
â€¢	Focus on *your own development* (see previous reminder), not just your job.  *Personal-development drive profesisonal performance*.  <br />
â€¢	Prioritize self-care, put your needs first, and always stay a step ahead.<br />
â€¢	***Never*** accept a promotion in name, if it doesn't include a bump in compensation.<br />
â€¢	Keep personal details about your life under wraps.  Don't overshare (I know, I write a blog -- like I'm one to talk ðŸ™ƒ). <br />
â€¢	Familiarity breeds contempt: beware some coworkers, consultants, or stakeholders who want to know *everything* about you (see previous reminder).  Whether they intend to or not, all humans instinctively judge. Over time, we all surender datapoints that people use.  It's just human nature, so don't nurture it!  People are inherently good, but at work human dynamics rule, just like everywhere else (e.g.Congress ðŸ˜‰). 
â€¢	Be kind and don't ever judge others and resist the base human instinct I mention in the previous reminder: [everyone you know is fighting a battle you know nothing about.  Be kind. Always.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6697537-everyone-you-meet-is-fighting-a-battle-you-know-nothing)
â€¢	HR is not there to protect *you*, they are there to protect the company.  They're almost-always good people, but their positions are by-design to serve & protect company interests.  <br /><br />

Here's to a great 2025!
