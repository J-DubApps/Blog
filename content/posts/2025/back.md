Everyone is replaceable—don’t oversacrifice exhaust yourself for any single job.
•	Thoroughly document your work and interactions.
•	Free snacks or lunch is a RTO eraser, or a reward for your hard work.  They're also unhealthy most of the time, so value yourself beyond that.
•	Unashamedly use your PTO days, you’ve earned them
•	Keep a record of important emails—proof beats promises.
•	Family ultimately outranks any job.
•	Some coworkers may secretly resent you.
•	Never stay at one job longer than 4 years unless the pay increase is substantial.
•	Never accept a promotion in name that doesn't accompany a bump in compensation.
•	If you become irreplaceable you're unpromotable.
•	Keep personal details about your life under wraps.  Don't overshare.
•	HR is not there to protect *you*, they are there to protect the company.

Focus on *your own development*, not just your job. Prioritize self-care, put your needs first, and always stay a step ahead.
