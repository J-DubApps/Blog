â€¢	Everyone is replaceableâ€”donâ€™t oversacrifice or exhaust yourself for any single job.<br />
â€¢	Thoroughly document your work.<br />
â€¢	If your skillset becomes *irreplaceable*, ***you*** become ***unpromotable***: refer to the previous two reminders.  Documenting and working out a cross-train approach ([read my post on that here](https://julianwest.me/Blog/empowering-independence-it/)) is key.<br />
â€¢	Keep a record of important emails (and interactions, when needed)â€”proof beats promises & hearsay.<br />
â€¢	Free snacks or lunch is not a reward for your hard work. Culture isnâ€™t about snacks, or the chow line: itâ€™s about creating an environment where people feel valued, supported, and empowered to do their best work. <br />
â€¢	Minimize "eating in your office" (see previous reminder) and take walks -- this goes the same for when remote-working. It's unavoidable that you need to eat there sometimes, but don't make it every day. <br />
â€¢	Even if you're not super social, when on-prem officing *use the breakroom* at least once a day. It is an ecosystem of human dynamics that *must be navigated* if you are to work out your company culture. Trust me on this.<br />
â€¢	Unashamedly use your PTO days, youâ€™ve earned them.<br />
â€¢	Family ultimately outranks any job.  *Always*.<br />
â€¢	Never stay at one job longer than 5 years unless the pay increase is substantial. Once you've stayed twice that long, even if the money is great, you trade a significant portion of your value in the job-market for *comfort*.  **And that's *ok*, but just understand that's the bargain -- and continue to develop yourself personally, and your skills professionally**. <br />
â€¢	Focus on *your own development* (see previous reminder), not just your job.  *Personal-development drives professional performance*!  <br />
â€¢	Prioritize self-care, put your needs first.<br />
â€¢	***Never*** accept a promotion in name, if it doesn't include a bump in compensation. If they can't afford your value, it's not your job to give them a discount. <br />
â€¢	Keep personal details about your life under wraps.  Don't overshare (I know, I have a blog -- I'm one to talk ðŸ™ƒ). <br />
â€¢	*Familiarity breeds contempt*: beware coworkers, consultants, or stakeholders who want to know *everything* about you (see previous reminder).  Whether they intend to or not, all humans instinctively judge. Over time, we all surender datapoints. It's just human nature to formulate a view, so don't nurture it!  People are inherently *good*, but work at mastering human dynamics. Life at an office is just like everywhere else (e.g.Congress ðŸ˜‰), so be smart. <br />
â€¢	Be kind and don't ever judge others.  Resist the base human instinct I mention above in the previous reminder: [everyone you know is fighting a battle you know nothing about.  Be kind. Always.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6697537-everyone-you-meet-is-fighting-a-battle-you-know-nothing) <br />
â€¢	HR is not there to protect *you*, they are there to protect the company.  They're often good people, but HR roles are by-design to serve & protect company interests.  <br /><br />

Here's to a great 2025 at the workplace!
