I wrote about this [in December](https://julianwest.me/Blog/employee-surveillance/) when I talked about how **Trust** beats invasive employee *tracking* ***every time***. Focusing on outcomes and accountability, instead of badge swipes or snooping metrics, is how organizations can build a culture of effectiveness and responsibility.  

But [according to Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/the-surveillance-tech-waiting-for-workers-as-they-return-to-the-office/), companies are plodding ahead with employer surveillance tech to monitor workers who return from Remote Work.  And in some of the most disturbing ways possible.  

> Under-desk sensors, in particular, have received high-profile backlash, perhaps because they are such an obvious piece of surveillance hardware rather than simply software designed to record work done on company machines
