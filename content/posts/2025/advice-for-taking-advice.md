> "*Don't take criticism from people you wouldn't take advice from*."

It sounds obvious, doesn't it? Yet many of us still let other people's opinions, judgments, and expectations shape our actions and beliefs. I've certainly done it—letting negativity from people I see as influential creep into my thinking, even when their advice isn’t aligned with *my goals*.  

Too often we hold back our potential by conforming to others' views of what our lives should look like. We're taught as kids to follow a safe, conventional path: university, steady job, mortgage. All good things, but how many of might us might dream of more? How many of us feel a calling beyond the routine?  

Many times in my life, when making a decision to move out of my comfort zone to do something *new* (maybe something beyond routine, something risky but possibly an opportunity for the extraordinary), there *always* seemed to be a naysayers to discourage me—and it was *rarely* anybody that I would normally take advice from in the first place.  Listening to critics who aren't a passionate friend or family invested in your success leads only to frustration, anxiety, and wasted time.  

Here are my straightforward bits of advice that I personally use to protect my mindset, and stay focused on what *truly matters*—my family, my clients or employers, and myself:  

- Surround yourself only with people who lift you higher and challenge you *constructively*, coming from genuine care and respect.

- Minimize time and interactions with those who tend to discourage your ambitions and dreams.  

- Completely remove and avoid people from your professional life who speak poorly of others behind their backs. If they do it to someone else, they'll do it to you.  And they aren't ever coming from a place of respect.  

Be *intentional* about guarding your mindset—it's your most valuable asset. **Don’t let anyone in who doesn’t genuinely support you** (or people without wisdom or capability to provide constructive candor and support) **advise you, or criticize you.  If somebody that you literally *wouldn't trade places with** is trying to give you advice: *don't take that advice***.
