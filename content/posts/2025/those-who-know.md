> "**Those who *know*, don't *say*.  Those who *say*, don't *know***"

The Chinese Philosopher [Lao Tzu (Laozi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi) first expressed the above, when he wrote: 

> “**He who knows does not speak; he who speaks does not know**.” 

**What Lao Tzu meant, and what I find *TRUE***: <br />

#### *True wisdom* cannot always captured in words, and that those who speak too readily often *lack* deeper understanding**.

Maybe Remember the above, for this era of LOUD voices owning our country's dialogue...  <br />

Maybe remember the above, when you hear supposed experts speaking on what used to be "*the news*", little more than confirmation bias platforms. Propaganda for the clicks and ads.  On all sides. <br />  

And maybe remember the above, for elected Culture Warriors using levers of power for little more than a trolling hobby...  <br />

...and maybe...

...we might keep some inner peace. 🙏🏻 <br />
