<br />
<small> The Chinese Philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">Lao Tzu (Laozi)</a> first expressed the saying above, several centuries ago:  </small> <br />

> ‚Äú***He who knows does not speak; he who speaks does not know***.‚Äù 


**What Lao Tzu *meant*, and what *I* find to be *TRUE***: 

#### *True wisdom* is not always captured in words, and those who speak too readily often *lack* deeper understanding.

<small> Maybe Remember the above, for this era of LOUD voices we're in... </small> <br />

<small> Maybe remember the above, when you hear supposed experts speaking on what used to be "*the news*"... </small> <br />  

<small> And maybe remember the above, for Culture Warriors throwing levers of power to [Troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang)#Corporate,_political,_and_special-interest_sponsored_trolls)...  </small> <br />

...then *maybe*...

...just maybe we keep some inner peace. üôèüèª <br /> <br />
