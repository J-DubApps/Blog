<small> A lot of talking heads, on all sides, proclaim to <i>know</i>—and say truths. The above is my mantra in response.  The Chinese Philosopher <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">Lao Tzu (Laozi)</a></b> expressed the saying above, centuries ago:  </small> <br />

> “***He who knows does not speak; he who speaks does not know***.” 


<small> <b>What Lao Tzu <i>meant</i>, and what <i>I</i> find to be <i>TRUE</i></b>: </small> <br />

#### *True wisdom* is not always captured in words, and those who speak too readily often *lack* deeper understanding.

<small> Maybe remember the above, for this era of LOUD voices we're in... </small> <br />

<small> Maybe remember the above, when you hear supposed experts speaking on what used to be "*the news*"... </small> <br />  

<small> And maybe remember the above, when you see Culture Warriors memes, and elected people [Trolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang)#Corporate,_political,_and_special-interest_sponsored_trolls)...  </small> <br />

...then *maybe*...

...just maybe we keep some inner peace. 🙏🏻 <br /> <br />
