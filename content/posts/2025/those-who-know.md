> "**Those who *know*, don't *say*.  Those who *say*, don't *know***..."

<small> The Chinese Philosopher [Lao Tzu (Laozi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi) first expressed the saying above, several centuries ago:  </small> <br />

> ‚Äú***He who knows does not speak; he who speaks does not know***.‚Äù 

<br />
 **What Lao Tzu *meant*, and what *I* find to be *TRUE***:

### *True wisdom* is not always captured in words, and those who speak too readily often *lack* deeper understanding.

<small> Maybe Remember the above, for this era of LOUD voices owning our country's dialogue... </small> <br />

<small> Maybe remember the above, when you hear supposed experts speaking on what used to be "*the news*"... </small> <br />  

<small> And maybe remember the above, for Culture Warriors throwing levers of power, for little more than trolling...  </small> <br />

...and *maybe*...

...just maybe we keep some inner peace. üôèüèª <br /> <br />
