This will be a quick update about my social media use in '25... <br /> 

The ***tl;dr*** of it is: **I'm stepping back from day-to-day Facebook use, and closing accounts on other Meta products altogether**.  *Read on for the deets*...<br />

## What's getting the boot?

• **Facebook & Instagram**: I’ve decided to go ***mostly inactive*** on those, deleting the apps from my devices, but **I'll keep my accounts enabled** and profiles "*on*".  I just won’t be really doing a lot, other than checking-in on friends and family. <br />

• **Threads & WhatsApp**: Both are **deleted** and accounts ***deactivated***. I’m just not finding value them, compared to other options. <br />

•	**Staying Reachable**: Don’t worry, I’m not disappearing! I remain active on **Facebook Messenger** (since I’m keeping my FB account open), and I am also still active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianwest/) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/julianwest.me). You can *always* find my whereabouts online from the "***About***" menu item up top (top-*right*) on this site [julianwest.me](https://julianwest.me).  <br />

Of course I'll *still stop by* Facebook from time-to-time, to keep tabs.  And my wife and close friends/fam will all keep me in the loop on big news, so I won't miss it.😊

## What's behind the change?

Over past two decades, I was an early adopter of just about every social media service that came out.  I was on Twitter in 2007. Facebook in 2008. And, yes, I had MySpace and Friendster accounts before that.  In those early days it was fun connecting to friends, family, or colleagues.  That whole "Web 2.0" era was wild, and fun for a little while. But over time social media followed [the Corey Doctrow formula](https://julianwest.me/Blog/enshittification-of-the-internet/), and it stopped being places for connecting people.  It morphed into an *information system* that destroyed traditional media's role in news and public discourse. In the past three+ years it's hard to ignore just how *dysfunctional* social media has become, and how its abused for influence.  It no longer really connects people, and each social media service struggled to balance moderation with free speech-going through manic changes, edicts, or [buyouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk). Now most social media divides peopl into their preferred tribal camps, and puts misinformation on blast. <br />

So I began a pullback from social media use the last couple years.  That involved deleting Twitter(X) from my phone, and setting my account to *private*. As Threads and Bluesky became compelling replacements, I deleted my 17 year-old Twitter(X) account altogether. And I haven't missed it it all.  <br />

Not that it should matter, here's a recap of what led me to make the change:

1.	**Time Hog**
I’ve noticed Facebook can be a huge time sink. I’d already been scaling back my usage for the last year, so this feels like a natural progression. <br /> 
2.	**Meta Products Are Slow & Bloated**
Between invasive-tracking and Ad software, everything loads at a snail’s pace on Meta properties. WhatsApp in particular felt clunky, even though it’s marketed as “lightweight.” <br /> 
3.	**Security Concerns**
Meta has such a poor track record of data breaches, and while WhatsApp claims to be *s*ecure* you can’t help but question it—especially when you see how it never replaced Facebook Messenger.  If seems like Signal, by contrast, does everything Whatsapp's original roadmap *said it would do*, before [Zuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) bought it and [nerfed it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance#Buffs_and_nerfs).
4.	“**Free**” **Means** [***You’re* the Product***](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marketshare/2012/03/05/if-youre-not-paying-for-it-you-become-the-product/) (*always has, always will*...)
With a company so focused on collecting our data, there’s always the feeling they’re monetizing every click. It’s not just selling ads with Zuck; it’s selling *us*.  Meta gets around *directly* selling your datay, but heavily-monitoring your interactions/searches/activity to target personalized ads at you ([*officially*](https://www.facebook.com/help/152637448140583/), anyway).  But they have to really get up in there and "*know you*" in order to provide advertisers with reports on how their ads are playing.  And they've never offered any kind of paid-tier, to give us choice.  The age-old rule applies: when it's free, *you're the product*. <br /> 
5.	**Moderation Rollback**
Zuck's recent move to significantly dial back moderation feels like we could be going back to the old 2015-2020 roller coaster Facebook.  With wild misinformation and conflict in my newsfeed again—yeah that's a '*nope' for me. <br /> 

## Where I'll Be Posting Here On Out... 

If you’re wondering where I’ll be posting my usual weird thoughts or (sometimes) witty takes—you're *on it right now*.  I'll be carrying-on right here on [my blog](https://julianwest.me/Blog/) and on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/julianwest.me). There's probably something for everyone on either place. On the blog, just clieck on the "Tags" area in the top menu to find topics of interest.  Though I mostly talk about tech stuff, the tags are there to help you find the non-tech stuff. Chances are if I was gonna say it on Facebook, I'll say it here and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/julianwest.me).

And yes, I’m still on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianwest/) for professional connections and the usual work stuff. And Facebook Messenger remains active of course.  I just don’t plan to actively use Facebook a lot.

## To my friends and family on Facebook etc...

...**I want to *stress*** this is just *my own* personal choice, and I am super supportive of my friends and family who enjoy Facebook etc. You do you! I will still stop by, now and then (*read-only*), to keep-up with the people I care about. But, for me, it's about preserving my focus and attention these days.  I also plan invest more time and energy in real-life interactions.  

## Wrapping Up

**So that's how it is with me in '25, on the social media thing**.  **My Facebook is a "*Contact*" page for me now**.  While I won't be posting anything new over there, when I stop by you'll occassionally "*see me*" from my *Likes*-or the odd comment-reply now and then.  You can still reach me through Messenger, and for whatever I'm "posting" you can always see it here on julianwest.me, or over on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/julianwest.me) (or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianwest/) for work stuff). <br /> 

Cheers and best wishes for an awesome 2025! --*Julian* <br /> <br />
