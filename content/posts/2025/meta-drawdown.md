This is an update about my social media whereabouts in '25.  If we're friends on Facebook you might've noticed [my profile](https://www.facebook.com/west.julian) is devoid of posts: just photos and memory events remain...and *this blog post* pinned to the top of my profile. <br />

The ***tl;dr*** of it is: **I'm stepping back from day-to-day Facebook use, and closing accounts on other Meta products**.  *Read on for the deets*...

## What's getting the boot?

• **Facebook & Instagram**: Still there but I'm going ***mostly inactive*** on those, **keeping my accounts enabled** to check-in with close friends and family from time-to-time. I deleted the apps from my phone. <br />

• **Threads & WhatsApp**: Both are **deleted** and accounts ***deactivated***. I find little value in them compared to other options like Signal and Bluesky. <br />

•	**Staying Reachable**: Don’t worry, I’m not disappearing! I remain active on **Facebook Messenger**, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianwest/), and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/julianwest.me). You can *always* find my latest whereabouts from the ["***About***" menu](https://julianwest.me/Blog/about/) on this site [***julianwest.me***](https://julianwest.me).  <br />

Of course I'm *still stopping-by* Facebook from time-to-time, keeping tabs when I get time. And my wife and closest friends/fam will keep me in the loop.  I won't be missing any big news, don't worry.😊

## What's behind the change?

Over the past two decades I was an early adopter of just about *every* social media there is. They didn't even *call it* "social media" back when I jumped on Twitter in 2007, or Facebook in 2008 (and, yes, I used MySpace and Friendster 😂). In those early days it was fun connecting to friends and family. That whole "[***Web 2.0***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)" era was wild and fun, but over time [the Corey Doctrow formula](https://julianwest.me/Blog/enshittification-of-the-internet/) took hold of social media-and most of it started to really suck. Social media isn't a place for *connecting people* anymore, not *really*: it morphed into an *information system* that destroyed traditional media, news-gathering, and public discourse. In the past five+ years it's hard to ignore how *dysfunctional* social media is, and how it's abused for influence.  As each site struggled to balance moderation with free speech-they all went through manic changes, edicts, or [buyouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk). Now social media either mostly divides people into their *preferred tribal camps*, or it puts harmful misinformation out on blast. <br />

I *get it* if you don't share the above take, but at any rate I began a quiet pullback the last couple years.  I deleted Twitter(X) from my phone in 2023 and set my account to *private*. Threads and Bluesky became compelling replacement in '24, so I deleted my 17 year-old Twitter(X) account altogether.  And in record time, Threads *itself* went through [the Corey Doctrow process of Ensh*tiffication](https://julianwest.me/Blog/enshittification-of-the-internet/). So I deleted Threads as well. <br />

*Not that it should matter*, but here's a recap of why I have cooled on [Zuck's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) Meta sites:

1.	**Time Hogs** <br />
Facebook can be a huge time sink.  More-so with Threads etc in the mix. I started scaling back my usage last year, so this feels like a natural thing to do. <br /> 
2.	**Meta Products Are Slow & Bloated** <br />
Between invasive-tracking and Ad software layers, everything loads at a snail’s pace on Meta properties.  It's like that everywhere, but really bad on Facebook. WhatsApp in particular felt clunky, even though it’s marketed as “lightweight.” <br /> 
3.	**Security Concerns**
Meta has such a poor track record of data breaches, and while WhatsApp claims to be *s*ecure* you can’t help but question it—especially when you see how it never replaced Facebook Messenger.  If seems like Signal, by contrast, does everything Whatsapp's original roadmap *said it would do*, before [Zuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) bought it and [nerfed it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance#Buffs_and_nerfs).
4.	“**Free**” **Means** [***You’re the Product***](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marketshare/2012/03/05/if-youre-not-paying-for-it-you-become-the-product/) (*always has, always will*...) <br />
With a company so focused on collecting our data, there’s always the feeling they’re monetizing every click. It’s not just selling Ads with Zuck; it’s selling *us*.  Meta gets around *directly* selling your data via heavy-monitoring of your interactions/searches/activity, to target personalized Ads at you ([*officially*](https://www.facebook.com/help/152637448140583/), anyway).  But they have to really get *up in there* and "*know you*" in order to provide advertisers with reports on how their Ads doing. And Meta has never offered any kind of paid-tier, to give us a choice about those things. The age-old rule applies: when it's *free*, [***you're the product***](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marketshare/2012/03/05/if-youre-not-paying-for-it-you-become-the-product/)! <br /> 
5.	**Moderation Rollback** <br />
[Zuck's recent move to significantly dial back fact-checking](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/zuckerbergs-fact-checking-rollback-ushers-chaotic-online-era-rcna186561) feels like we're going back to the old 2014-2020 Facebook, with wild misinformation and conflict in our newsfeed again—yeah that's a '*nope*' for me. <br /> 

## My Whereabouts Here On Out... 

If you’re wondering where I’ll be posting my usual weird thoughts or (sometimes) witty takes—you're [on it *right now*](https://julianwest.me).  I'll be carrying-on [right here](https://julianwest.me/Blog/) and on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/julianwest.me). Just click on the ["Tags"](https://julianwest.me/Blog/tags/) area in the top menu to find topics of interest, or [**click here**](https://julianwest.me/Blog/nav-tips/) for other shortcuts around this blog.  Though I mostly talk about tech stuff, it's not all tech and there's always [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/julianwest.me).  Chances are if I was gonna say it on Facebook, I'll be saying it on one of those places, instead.

And yes, I’m still on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianwest/) for professional connections and the usual work stuff. And Facebook Messenger remains active of course.  I just don’t plan to actively use Facebook a lot.

## To my friends and family on Facebook etc... (love ya!)

...**I wanna *stress*** this is just *my own personal choice*, and I am super supportive of my friends and family still enjoying Facebook / Insta / etc. *You do you*! I will still stop by now and then to keep-up with the folks I care about. But, *for me* anyway, it's about preserving my focus and attention these days.  I also plan invest more time and energy in real-life interactions.

## Wrapping Up

**So that's how it is with me in '25, on the social media stuff**.  **My Facebook is mostly just a "*Contact*" page** for family/friends to track me, now.  While I won't be posting anything new over there you might occassionally "*see me*" from my *Likes*-or the odd comment-reply now and then.  You can still reach me through Messenger, too.  As for whatever I'm "posting" these days -- well, it's always here on [julianwest.me](https://julianwest.me) or over on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/julianwest.me) (or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianwest/) for work stuff). <br /> 

Cheers and best wishes for an awesome 2025! --*Julian* <br /> <br />
