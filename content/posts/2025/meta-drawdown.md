This will be a quick update about my social media presence in '25... the ***tl;dr*** of it is-**I'm stepping back from day-to-day Facebook use, and closing accounts on other Meta products altogether**.  Read on for deets on what I'm axing, and why...<br />

### What's getting the boot?

‚Ä¢ **Facebook & Instagram**: I‚Äôve decided to go mostly inactive on those, but I am keeping my Facebook profile "*on*" and not cancelling it (more about that below).  I just won‚Äôt be really posting anything new over there.  My Instagram account is also going dormant at this point. <br /> <br />

‚Ä¢ **Threads & WhatsApp**: Both have been deleted and accounts deactivated. I‚Äôm just not finding value in continuing to use them, compared to other options in those spaces. <br /> <br />

‚Ä¢	**Staying Reachable**: Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not disappearing! I‚Äôll remain active on Facebook Messenger (since I‚Äôm keeping my FB account open), and I am also still active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianwest/), and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/julianwest.me). You can always find my whereabouts online using the "***About***" menu item, on the top-right on this site.  <br />

Of course I'll *still stop by* Facebook from time-to-time, to keep tabs.  And my wife and close friends/fam will all keep me in the loop on big news, so I won't miss it.üòä 

### What's behind the change?

Over past decade, I've used quite a bit of social media.  I was on Twitter in 2007. Facebook in 2008. And, yes, I had MySpace and Friendster accounts.  If I had a friend trying some site out, usually I would too. And, early on, it was fun connecting to friends, family, or colleagues in tech.  That whole "Web 2.0" era was a blast early on, but over time social media became an information system for news, not just platforms for communication and connecting with people.  And in the past three+ years I have come to see how dysfunctional social media platforms became. As each service struggled to balance moderation with free speech, they went through manic changes, edicts, or [buyouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk). <br />

Consequently, last year I began a pullback from social media use.  That involved deleting Twitter(X) from my phone, and setting my account to *private*.  As Threads and Bluesky became compelling replacements for it, I eventually just deleted my 17 year-old Twitter(X) account altogether. And I really haven't missed it it all.  <br />

But I still found myself bouncing between Threads and Facebook, and it's a real time sink for me.  So I decided to close-out of Threads and Whatsapp, and go inactive on Facebook/Instagram.  Though I have never been about giving anybody reasons for such things, I'll share my thinking on all this below-anyway:

1.	**Time Hog**
I‚Äôve noticed Facebook can be a huge time sink. I‚Äôd already been scaling back my usage for the last year, so this feels like a natural progression.
2.	**Meta Products Are Slow & Bloated**
Between tracking and ad software, everything loads at a snail‚Äôs pace. WhatsApp in particular felt clunky, even though it‚Äôs marketed as ‚Äúlightweight.‚Äù
3.	**Security Concerns**
Meta has a track record of data breaches, and while WhatsApp claims to be secure, you can‚Äôt help but question it‚Äîespecially when you see how it never replaced Facebook Messenger.
4.	‚Äú**Free**‚Äù **Means *You‚Äôre* the Product** (*always has, always will*...)
With a company so focused on collecting our data, there‚Äôs always the feeling they‚Äôre monetizing every click. It‚Äôs not just selling ads with [Zuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg); it‚Äôs selling *us*.  Meta gets around *directly* selling your datay, but heavily-monitoring your interactions/searches/activity to target personalized ads at you ([*officially*](https://www.facebook.com/help/152637448140583/), anyway).  But they have to really get up in there and "*know you*" in order to provide advertisers with reports on how their ads are playing.  And they've never offered any kind of paid-tier, to give us choice.  The age-old rule applies: when it's free, *you're the product*.
5.	**Moderation Rollback**
Zuck's recent move to significantly dial back moderation feels like we could be on that old 2015-2020 roller coaster Facebook.  With wild misinformation and conflict in feeds‚Äîsomething I simply got no patience with anymore. <br /> <br />

### Where to Find Me Now

If you‚Äôre wondering where I‚Äôll be posting my signature weird thoughts or (sometimes) witty takes‚Äîit‚Äôll be right here where you're reading this.  I've rejuvenated julianwest.me, where I'll be doing all that-and more longform writing on tech and other things.  This site‚Äôs been around for 17 years (and even longer, if I go back to its first iteration in 1997), but I‚Äôm excited to breathe new life into it.  My blog has always been the place where I share fun stories, personal insights, and random musings. 

### To my friends and family on Instagram and Facebook

...I want to stress: this is just my own personal choice, and I am super supportive of my friends, family, and colleagues who enjoy Facebook, Instagram, etc. You do you! For me, it's about focus these days-and leaner social media use lets me invest more energy in real-life interactions.

And yes, I‚Äôm still on LinkedIn for professional connections and all the usual work stuff. If you send me a message on Facebook Messenger, I‚Äôll see it eventually, but I don‚Äôt plan to actively post or scroll the news feeds over there.

### Wrapping Up

So that's my continued social media downsizing journey in '25. I‚Äôm not deleting my Facebook account entirely, so you can still reach me through Messenger.  But if you‚Äôre looking to keep up with me day-to-day, just stop by julianwest.me. I‚Äôll be sharing more content there than I ever did on Facebook, and I‚Äôd love for you to follow along...
