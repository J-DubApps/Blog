[Check out this March 2024 Announcement of Stargate](https://qz.com/microsoft-openai-stargate-supercomputer-1851375309), just in case anyone was wondering how / why "Stargate" data center buildings already exist in Texas, so soon after Stargate "was announced" -- it's because this was a actually a re-announcement / PR boots by the Trump Admin for something that already existed.   Sam and Larry just showed-up to do a bit of a kabuki theater "re-announcement" dance, for all of us.  Nice. <br />

No wonder [Satya was emphatic and making-clear the other day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb_ZJylekWo) that Microsoft is still "good for $80 billion" for this already-existing project, regardless of re-announcements. <br />

I think a lot of previous admin initiatives go through this, it's nothing new or unique to the Trump admin.  But I am surprised that Trump didn't even bother re-branding it-just (re)announcing it as if it's a *new thing*.
