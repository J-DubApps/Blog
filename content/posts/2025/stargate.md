[**Check out this *March 2024* Announcement of Stargate**](https://qz.com/microsoft-openai-stargate-supercomputer-1851375309), just in case anyone was wondering how / why its data center buildings *already exist* in Texas, so soon after Stargate "was announced" -- it's because this was a actually a re-announcement / PR boost by the Trump Admin.  Sam and Larry (along w/ Softbank) did a bit of a kabuki theater "re-announcement" dance, for all of us.  Nice. <br />

No wonder [Satya was emphatic the other day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb_ZJylekWo) that Microsoft is still "good for $80 billion" for this already-existing project.  I *do* think [Softbank's](https://www.softbank.jp/en//) stepped-up involvement probably made the "hey look!" re-boost worth it, though. <br />

I think a lot of previous admin initiatives go through this: the next admin re-boosts it, to continue momentum. But I am surprised that Trump didn't even try to re-brand itâ€”just (re)announcing it.  And doing so as if it's a *brand new thing*.
