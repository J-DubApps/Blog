> “***Culture eats strategy for breakfast***.” - [**Peter Drucker**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker)

Drucker *also* said: "***what gets measured gets managed***" --- and if you're measuring and managing *the wrong things*, your company Culture can suffer.  

Culture is usually the LAST thing C-suite wants to figure out, but it's the ONE THING that can make your staff just completely killer-effective. Strategy may *talk* about "mission", but it's ***CULTURE*** that gets any mission MOVING.  

Know what *also* eats strategy for breakfast?  

***Execution***.
