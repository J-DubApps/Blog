> “***Culture eats strategy for breakfast***.” - [**Peter Drucker**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker)

Drucker also said: "***what gets measured gets managed***" --- and if you're measuring and managing the wrong things, your company's Culture suffers.  

Culture is the LAST thing C-suite ever wants to figure out, but it's the ONE THING that can make your staff just completely killer-effective. Strategy may talk about "mission", but it's CULTURE that gets the mission MOVING.

Know what *also* eats strategy for breakfast? 

***Execution***.
