> “*We are not outnumbered. We are out-organized*.”  
> — Malcolm X

*Whichever* your political persuasions, each political majority gets its day in the sun (in power)—and the US pendulum swings, in its usual unpredictable cycle, to "move the sunshine" to the political minority.  **That's the whole ballgame in US politics, *usually***.  

But Americans have turned that pendulum (and politics in general) on it's side, and [*beyond* civics](https://julianwest.me/Blog/jan-6/). Our civic processes have become tribal sports—not exactly new territory for the US. The problem arises when the resisting movement is disorganized and not seen—the modern equivalent of that is today's *mostly online "activism"*: effective resistance is a *contact sport*, and must involve what I call the "***Power Dynamics of Protest***."  I worry Gen-Z'ers and Millennials, who are loudly-concerned about these times *online*, haven't contemplated *how* to organize in the real world.  

And *why would they*? Our country has only been in this territory of "arguing *beyond* our Civic process" a few times: 1861-1865, Women's Suffrage, or Civil Rights — to name a few. They were all territory where anger and viciousness threatened dismantling our norms (and some *did*). Political Majorities, during times like this anyway, tell you that it's *not* as bad as you think it is. They usually say this right after a controversial law passes, some norm crumbles, or institution is challenged.  

I get it: *I know* a significant portion of American society is saying, "*this time it feels different*."  I hear that a lot.  People seem to be concerned the pendulum I mention *above* has been forcefully-grabbed by a *minority*. That the pendulum is being influenced, held down maybe. I've heard this on *both sides*.  And here in 2025, it's the word "*coup*" again, as it was in 2021. **All I can say to *any* of that, is this**: 

I live in hope, and so I believe (and *belief*, after all, often involves *hope*) we may not be in some kind of "coup", as people claim: but I am open to being *wrong* about that, and I am worried too. So *if others do* sincerely believe the US *is* undergoing a coup and things really are *dire*—then **I ask them three simple questions which I haven't heard *anyone* answer**:  

1. **Do you intend to convince non "*like-minded*" people to your view, instead of just brushing people off as "*lost*" and un-winnable toward at least *some* of your concerns, or points-of-view**?  ***hint***: if you can't convince at least *some others* outside of your core groups to an emergency -- you'll *never* organize to advance your cause.  

2. **Isn't it time to get out of the social media bubbles, stop posting memes, and pursue peaceful action**?  

3. **Isn't it time to *stop* just "*being right*", and *start* being *effective***?  

A possible 4th question any organizer (*whichever* side you're on) should ask themselves is: **what does "*effectiveness*" look like**?   

I think before any organizer can answer the above questions—they ***really need*** **to learn and understand the** ***Power Dynamics*** **of the *State* in any human society**. Well, if they want to be *effective* in advancing their cause, anyway...  

### Force vs. Power: Understanding the Difference

Let's think for a second about *the difference between* ***Power*** and ***Force***. These two words are often used together, and contrasted against one another. They're two *very different* methods of getting things *done*. Understanding this, and how established leaders in ***power*** wield either one of these (especially when it comes to peaceful protest), is something *every activist leader* better understand, if they're serious about organizing and being *effective*.  Below is your lesson.  

The *difference* between between ***power*** and ***force*** lies in the *outcome*: the **result**. ***Power*** (influencing those in the governing/ruling class, and leveraging the [body politic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_politic)) produces outcomes that generally fall into place without a lot of resistance. ***Force***, *on the other hand*, also produces outcomes; *however*, ***force*** nearly *always* meets with ***resistance*** of some sort.  *True* ***power*** typically doesn't need to apply coersion or ***Force***.  ***Force*** also usually produces outcomes *other than* what those using it (the ruling-class) *wanted*, or had in mind when applying it.  

No one likes to be *forced*, after all, and most humans will seek ways to thwart whatever or whoever is trying to *force* something on them. And when ***force*** produces an outcome at all, that outcome will *only* stay in place for as long as the ***force*** can continue to be applied effectively. Once ***force*** goes away, or is *removed*, or is met with an ***opposing force***; those being *forced* will naturally come up with ways to *get around* that ***force***, or ***force*** *back*, or evade the punishment that it threatens. When this happens in a Republic bound by Democratic institutions, the outcome produced by ***force*** usually begins to unravel.  **That is your opening**: if you're truly dedicated to your cause, will meet *any burden* to effect the change you are demanding, you must be willing to use [***non-violence***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence) and directly to *invite* the possibility of ***force*** being **used upon you**—*strategically*.  I am sorry, but it's just how it *is* if you ever want to bring any *effective* or meaningful check against ***power***.  

In any Democracy ***power*** is, by its very nature, successful in hindsight. *True* ***power*** doesn't need to impose threats or penalties, as it inspires genuine *agreement* with majorities—which inoculates *power-based outcomes* against any meaningful ***resistance***. That's the history, that's facts.  

***Force***, by its *own* nature, *isn't successful* long-term—and it certainly *isn't* "powerful" in a Democratic society due to unpredictable outcomes and harms ***force*** can produce. Again: **this is your opening** if you are truly dedicated to whatever change you're trying to effect.  Here's how, and *why*:  

**Access to *true power* lies in *force-free* communication, influence, and (in a Republic bound by Democratic institutions) exercise of *true power* usually happens within the society's agree-upon norms**.  Once you're *outside* of those norms, ***weak power*** (not true ***power*** at all) usually will resort to ***force*** to stop ***resistance***.  Again: **this is your opening**. You likely cannot sway majorities to see any legitimacy in your cause, without using this opening.  You have to *risk* having ***force*** used against you. That is history, I'm afraid.  

So verily I must say unto any organizer or peaceful protester, whatever your cause—when you're *done talking* about "being *right*" (whatever you're upset about) the domains of non-violent *action* and *effectiveness* are there to remind you: **whatever you want, it will never be a comfort-zone**.  And I get it: nobody wants to contemplate having any kind of ***force*** of the *State* used against them.  But contemplate, they must, and decide if any cause is worth the pain.    

### Managing, and Using, the Power vs. Force Dynamic in Peaceful Protest

The [***Force Dynamics***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_dynamics#Context) of any *State* (how a government, and those running it, *think* about ***force*** vs *using* ***force***) is a subject of long-study.   In Republics bound by Democracy, the Dynamics of ***force*** get fairly simple, when you boil it all down: people *in* ***power***, and effective opposition organizers alike, tend to understand that ***power*** lies *in* their numbers.  Organizing a peaceful-movement is a kind of ***power*** itself, the power of numbers of people willing to suffer for the change they believe in. On one side, using the ***power*** of their numbers to avoid escalation and engage in win/win compromises is one positive use of ***power***—and has been the *norm* in this country because of the institution of the ballot box, and the principle of "one man, one vote".  It is rare that movements in our history endured violent struggle, but the potential is never zero (see Revolutionary War, Civil War, and Civil Rights eras—to name a few).  

So a healthy ***power*** structure, in a healthy Republic (bound by Democracy) will leverage ***power*** to achieve win/win compromises and avoid escalation. The *problem* is that majorities engaging in single-party rule may not go the route of win/win compromise.  And the higher the stakes, the more likely ***force*** will be leveraged by those in ***power*** (especially a majority that is a slim one, and bitterly-dedicated to its own cause).  

But peaceful non-violent protests, in high enough numbers in Democracies, can inoculate themselves from any deadly-aspects of ***force***—but *only* if they're willing to risk inviting (and being subject to) deadly ***force*** *in the first place*.  It's a terrible [Catch-22](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Catch-22), but this is the risk and [poker bluff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluff_(poker)) movements have leveraged since time immemorial. 

#### Ways to Manage the ***Force Dynamics*** in Protesting Weak or Corrupt *Power*

**Any non-violent change requires one side to**:  

1. **Be wholly and completely non-violent, and be committed to non-violence**.
2. **Be making your case to EVERYONE**.
3. **Be willing to risk and endure *force* used upon you** (including bodily injury).
4. **Be engaging with people who may hate, dislike, or not agree with you.**
5. **Be engaging with like-minded people in *places* you may not have considered looking**.  One area of effective non-violent protest includes deep fraternization with police and enlisted military members: a well-known method of inoculating your movement from the deadly harms risked when ***force*** gets used.  Because *they* will be the humans asked to employ ***force*** upon you.  Too many movements isolate from, and attack, potentially sympathetic humans working in the police, military, etc.  I point back to #2 above: if your cause it right, why aren't you engaging everyone?  

#### The ***Force Dynamics*** of Protest In Action

Those *in* ***power*** who are dependent on raw ***force*** occurring—such as violent crackdowns to maintain their ***power***—will always risk collapse of their support and effectiveness. They may achieve momentary gains after invoking ***force***; however, over the long term it generates *more* ***resistance***—which undermines ***force***'s original objective.  *And that*, in most Democratic societies, ultimately reduces ***power***.  I'm sorry if it sounds like I am boiling all this down to very simple math: but it is 100% the case that, **if you aren't willing to organize and *peacefully* engage with *power*—while *inviting the possibility* of *force***—you're never going to move beyond the memes, banners, and social media noise of today.  

### The Takeaway (Or *My* Takeway...)

**I believe in peace** and ***never*** want to see any society (*especially* my own) endure harms from protesting.  I ***do not*** support violence of any kind, and my *purpose* in writing this thinkpiece is to remind our younger people: if a perceived threat against our democracy (or any urgent issue, really) is ***real***, and a cause is *just*...it is *not enough* to talk and continue ***being right*** about your complaint.  You *must* make your case and convince people *outside* of your bubble—and that means ***organizing*** and dedication.  If you believe ***power*** is being abused against you, or others, you must be willing to: **a**. never stop peacefully-engaging with others and making your case, and **b.** be willing to take non-violent protest and navigate the *dynamics* between ***Power*** and ***Force***.

No matter what you believe, no matter your political persuasion, or whatever your cause: **I hope we can all agree on the hope that our society moves on from this troubling era, in peace**.  We have so many challenges with technology, economic disruption, and things humans need their governments *and* citizens to *work-together* on solving those challenges.  I have no idea what the future brings, but I live in hope our country can somehow limp along to meet that future *together*. It's *all* I can do.  **Because nobody has organized yet**.  **Nobody outside of social media bubbles are trying to reach *me***. **So I advise those that *don't agree with me* that we're going to be fine**...***to consider the following***: 

With all the social media memes, and messaging, and "***being right***"...aren't you giving-up ***being effective***? **Are you failing to meet this moment, with peaceful action**?   If your cause (whatever it is) is *truly just*: without effective means to spread your message beyond the *social media bubble*, you're just leaving potential like-minded supporters in the dark. If you never peacefully-*organize* ***and*** embrace non-violent pursuit of your goal—and are willing to accept the risk of ***force*** used *against you*—then what is the point?  Sure, free speech is great, but why all the memes with no action? *I get it*—maybe you feel powerless. But the "***Power Dynamics*** of Protest" tell you: ***you have power*** here, if you can peacefully organize and move to use it.  

I mean...I am just one person, and I might be missing something.  It just seems like people signal virtue, seek justice, or "*defend democracy*" in an *online world* in ***language-only***...a realm of ***non-action***, traditionally.  If those outraged by something, *anything*, is *only* self-expression *online*...what's happening for people to *peacefully-organize*?  If it's all only meme-making and *online activism*, what's the point?  Are people willing to *do the work* to peacefully organize, and convince others to join them?  Are you committed enough that you are prepared experience ***force***, and potential harm, while practicing non-violence in response?    

Just food for thought.  It's possible I'm entirely wrong about these weird times we live in.
