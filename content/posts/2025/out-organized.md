> “*We are not outnumbered. We are out-organized*.”  
> — Malcolm X

*Whichever* your political persuasions, each political majority gets its day in the sun (in power)—and the US pendulum swings, in its usual unpredictable cycle, to "move the sunshine" to the political minority.  **That's the whole ballgame in US politics, *usually***.  

But Americans have turned that pendulum (and politics in general) beyond civics, and into tribal sports—a new territory for the US, but not unheard of in history. The problem here arises when one side misunderstands: it's a *contact sport* involving Power Dynamics I don't believe Gen-Z'ers or Millennials understand, or have experience thinking about.  

And why would they?  Our country has only been in this territory of "arguing beyond Civics" a few times: 1861-1865, Women's Sufferage, or Civil Rights — to name a few.  They were all territory where anger and viciousness could threaten dismantling our norms. Political Majorities, during times like this anyway, tend to tell you that it's *not* as bad as you think it is.  They usually say this right after a controversial law passes, some norm crumbles, or institution is challenged.  

I get it: *I know* a significant portion of American society is saying, "*this time it feels different*".  I hear that a lot.  People seem to be concerned that the pendulum I mentioned *above* has been forcefully-grabbed by a *minority*. That the pendulum is being influenced, held down maybe. I've heard this on *both sides*.  And this time, in 2025, it's the word "*coup*". All I can say to *any* of that, is this: 

I live in hope and don't believe (and *belief* is, after all, partially *hope*-based) that we are really in some kind of "coup", as people claim. But if I am *wrong* (certainly open to that), and *if others do* sincerely believe the US *is* undergoing some kind of coup and things are *dire*—then **I ask them three simple questions which I haven't heard *anyone* answer**:  

1. **Do you intend to convince non "*like-minded*" people to your view, instead of just brushing people off as "*lost*" and un-winnable toward at least *some* of your concerns, or points-of-view**?  ***hint***: if you can't convince at least *some others* outside of your core groups to an emergency -- you'll *never* organize to advance your cause.

3. **Isn't it time to get out of the social media bubbles, stop posting memes, and pursue peaceful action**?

3. **Isn't it time to *stop* just "*being right*", and *start* being *effective***?

And 3rd question any organizer (*whichever* side you're on) should ask themselves is: what does "*effectiveness*" look like?   

I think before any organizer can answer the above questions—they ***really need*** **to learn and understand the** ***Power Dynamics*** **of the *State* in any human society**. Well, if they want to be *effective* and bring people to their cause, anyway...  

### Force vs. Power: Understanding the Difference

Let's think for a second about *the difference between* ***Power*** and ***Force***. These two words are often used together, and contrasted against one another. They're two *very different* methods of getting things *done*. Understanding this, and how established leaders in ***power*** wield either one of these (especially when it comes to peaceful protest), is something *every activist leader* better understand, if they're serious about organizing and being *effective*.  Below is your lesson.  

The *difference* between between ***power*** and ***force*** lies in the *outcome*: the **result**. ***Power*** (influencing those in the governing/ruling class, and leveraging the [body politic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_politic)) produces outcomes that generally fall into place without a lot of resistance. ***Force***, *on the other hand*, also produces outcomes; *however*, ***force*** nearly *always* meets with ***resistance*** of some sort.  *True* ***power*** doesn't need ***Force***.   ***Force*** also usually produces outcomes *other than* what those using it (the ruling-class) *wanted*, or had in mind when applying it.  

No one likes to be *forced*, after all, and most humans will seek ways to thwart whatever or whoever is trying to *force* something on them. And when ***force*** produces an outcome at all, that outcome will *only* stay in place for as long as the ***force*** can continue to be applied effectively. Once ***force*** goes away, or is *removed*, or is met with an ***opposing force***; those being *forced* will naturally come up with ways to *get around* that ***force***, or ***force*** *back*, or evade the punishment that it threatens. When this happens in a Republic bound by Democratic institutions, the outcome produced by ***force*** usually begins to unravel.  **That is your opening**: if you're truly dedicated to your cause, will meet *any burden* to effect the change you are demanding, you must be willing to use [***non-violence***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence) and directly to *invite* the possibility of ***force*** being **used upon you**—*strategically*.  I am sorry, but it's just how it *is* if you ever want to bring any *effective* or meaningful check against ***power***.  

In any Democracy ***power*** is, by its very nature, successful in hindsight. *True* ***power*** doesn't need to impose threats or penalties, as it inspires genuine *agreement* with majorities—which inoculates *power-based outcomes* against any meaningful ***resistance***. That's the history, that's facts.  

***Force***, by its *own* nature, *isn't successful* long-term—and it certainly *isn't* "powerful" in a Democratic society due to unpredictable outcomes and harms ***force*** can produce. Again: **this is your opening** if you are truly dedicated to whatever change you're trying to effect.  Here's how, and *why*:  

**Access to *true power* lies in *force-free* communication, influence, and (in a Republic bound by Democratic institutions) exercise of *true power* usually happens within the society's agree-upon norms**.  Once you're *outside* of those norms, ***weak power*** (not true ***power*** at all) usually will resort to ***force*** to stop ***resistance***.  Again: **this is your opening**. You likely cannot sway majorities to see any legitimacy in your cause, without using this opening.  You have to *risk* having ***force*** used against you. That is history, I'm afraid.  

So verily I must say unto any organizer or peaceful protester, whatever your cause—when you're *done talking* about "being *right*" (whatever you're upset about) the domains of non-violent *action* and *effectiveness* are there to remind you: **whatever you want, it will never be a comfort-zone**.  And I get it: nobody wants to contemplate having any kind of ***force*** of the *State* used against them.  But contemplate, they must, and decide if any cause is worth the pain.    

### Managing, and Using, the Power vs. Force Dynamic

The [***Force Dynamics***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_dynamics#Context) of any *State* (how a government, and those running it, *think* about ***force*** vs *using* ***force***) is a subject of long-study.   In Republics bound by Democracy, the Dynamics of ***force*** get fairly simple, when you boil it all down: people *in* ***power***, and effective opposition organizers alike, tend to understand that ***power*** lies *in* their numbers.  Organizing a peaceful-movement is a kind of ***power*** itself, the power of numbers of people willing to suffer for the change they believe in. On one side, using the ***power*** of their numbers to avoid escalation and engage in win/win compromises is one positive use of ***power***—and has been the *norm* in this country because of the institution of the ballot box and the principle of "one man, one vote".  It is rare that movements in our history endured violent struggle, but the potential is never zero (see Revolutionary War, Civil War, and Civil Rights eras—to name a few).  

So a healthy ***power*** structure, in a healthy Republic (bound by Democracy) will leverage ***power*** to achieve win/win compromises and avoid escalation. The *problem* is that majorities engaging in single-party rule may not go the route of win/win compromise.  And the higher the stakes, the more likely ***force*** will be leveraged by those in ***power*** (especially a majority that is a slim one, and bitterly-dedicated to its own cause).  

But peaceful non-violent protests, in high enough numbers in Democracies, can inoculate themselves from any deadly-aspects of ***force***—but *only* if they're willing to risk inviting (and being subject to) deadly ***force*** in the *first place*.  It's a terrible [Catch-22](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Catch-22), but this is the risk and [poker bluff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluff_(poker)) movements have leveraged since time immemorial. 

#### Ways to Manage the ***Force Dynamics*** of Weak or Corrupt ***Power***

**Any non-violent change requires one side to**:  

1. **Be wholly and completely non-violent, and be committed to non-violence**.
2. **Be making your case to EVERYONE**.
3. **Be willing to risk and endure *force* used upon you** (including bodily injury).
4. **Be engaging with people who may hate, dislike, or not agree with you.**
5. **Be engaging with like-minded people in *places* you may not have considered looking**.  One area of effective non-violent protest includes deep fraternization with police and enlisted military members: a well-known method of inoculating your movement from the deadly harms risked when ***force*** gets used.  Because *they* will be the humans asked to employ ***force*** upon you.  Too many movements isolate from, and attack, potentially sympathetic humans working in the police, military, etc.  I point back to #2 above: if your cause it right, why aren't you engaging everyone?  

#### The ***Force Dynamics*** In Action

Those *in* ***power*** who are dependent on raw ***force*** occurring—such as violent crackdowns to maintain their ***power***—will always risk collapse of their support and effectiveness. They may achieve momentary gains after invoking ***force***; however, over the long term it generates *more* ***resistance***—which undermines ***force***'s original objective.  *And that*, in most Democratic societies, ultimately reduces ***power***.  I'm sorry if it sounds like I am boiling all this down to very simple math: but it is 100% the case that, **if you aren't willing to organize and *peacefully* engage with *power*—while *inviting the possibility* of *force***—you're never going to move beyond the memes, banners, and social media noise of today.  

### The Takeaway

**I believe in peace** and never want to see any society or country (*especially* my own) endure harms from *peaceful* protest.  I do not support violence of any kind. The *purpose* of this thinkpiece is to remind people that: if a perceived threat against the country is real, and a cause is just...it is *not enough* talk and continue ***being right*** about your complaint.  You must make your case and convince people *outside* of your bubble—and that means ***organizing*** and dedication.  If you believe ***power*** is being abused against you, or others, you must be willing to: **a**. never stop peacefully-engaging with others and making your case, and **b.** be willing to take non-violent protest to move your cause forward, while navigating the *dynamics* between ***Power*** and ***Force***.  

No matter what you believe, no matter your political persuasion, or whatever your cause: **I hope we can all agree on the hope that our society needs to move past this troubled era, in peace**.  We have so many challenges with technology, economic disruption, and things humans need their governments *and* citizens to *work-together* on solving those challenges.  I have no idea what the future brings, but I live in hope our country can somehow limp along to meet that future *together*. It's all I can do.  Because nobody has organized yet.  Nobody is trying to reach *me*. **So I advise those that *don't agree with me* that we're going to be fine...to consider the following**: 

**With all the social media memes, and "*being right*", aren't you giving-up *being effective***? **Are you failing to meet this moment**?   If your cause (whatever it is) is *truly just*: without effective means to spread your message beyond the *social media bubble*, you're just leaving potential like-minded supporters in the dark. If you never peacefully-*organize* ***and*** embrace non-violent pursuit of your goal—and are willing to accept the risk of ***force*** used *against you*—then what is the point?  Sure, free speech is great, but why all the memes with no action? *I get it*—maybe you feel powerless.  But ***Power Dynamics*** tell you: ***you have power***, if you can peacefully organize and move to use it.  

I mean...why signal virtue, seek justice, or defend democracy (whatever you are passionate about)...*then not peacefully-organize*, and be willing to *do the work* to convince others to peacefully join you?  Are you committed enough that you understand non-violence will still invite physical ***force***, and potential harm?  Until some people see that, you are just part of the noise.  

Just food for thought.
