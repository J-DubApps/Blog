Whichever your political persuasion, each side gets its day in the sun (in power)—and the US pendulum swings in its unpredictable cycle.  

Yes *I know*: some of you are thinking, "this time it feels *different*".  Some of you are thinking the pendulum may be grabbed and influenced, held down maybe.  All I can say to *any* of that is this: 


### Force vs. Power: Understanding the Difference

Let's think for a second about *the difference between* ***Power*** and ***Force***. These two words are often used together, and contrasted against one another.  But in reality, they refer to very different methods of getting things done.  Dealing with these two words, and how established leaders wield them, when it comes to protesting, is something every activist leader better understand deeply if they're organizing.  

The difference between between ***power*** and ***force*** lies in the *outcome*: the **result**. ***Power*** (leveraging influence of the governing/ruling class, and the [body politic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_politic)) produces outcomes that generally fall into place without a lot of resistance. ***Force***, on the other hand, can produce outcomes; however, ***force*** nearly always meets with ***resistance*** of some sort. Force also usually produces outcomes that other than what the ruling-class wants, or had in mind when applying it.  No one likes to be *forced*, after all, and most any human will seek ways to thwart whatever or whoever is trying to *force* something on them.  

And when ***force*** produces an outcome at all, that outcome will only stay in place for as long as the ***force*** can continue to be applied effectively. Once ***force*** goes away, or is *removed*, or is met with an ***opposing force***; those being *forced* will naturally come up with ways to *get around* the ***force***, or ***force*** *back*, or evade the punishment that it threatens. When this happens in a Republic bound by Democratic institutions, the outcome produced by ***force*** begins to unravel.  

In any Democracy ***Power*** is, by its very nature, successful in hindsight.  It doesn't need to impose threats or penalties, but typically inspires genuine *agreement* with majorities—which inoculates *power-based outcomes* against meaningful ***resistance***. ***Force***, by its own nature, isn't successful long-term—and it certainly *isn't* powerful in a Democratic society due to less predictable outcomes and harms it can produce. **Access to *true power* lies in *force-free* communication, influence, and (in a Republic bound by Democratic institutions) exercise of *true power* happens it within the society's agree-upon norms**.  

So people *in* ***power*** and opposition organizers alike all know that an element of ***power*** lies *in* their numbers. On one side, using the ***power*** of their numbers to avoid escalation and engage in win/win  Peaceful nonviolent protests in high enough numbers, in peaceful Democracies, often will innoculate themselves from ***force***

If either those *in* ***power*** or those in social or political movements are dependent on raw force occuring—such as violent crackdowns—both sides risk collapse of their support and effectiveness.  Either side may achieve momentary gains when ***force*** is invoked *by* them or *to* them; however, over the long term they risk collapse or generate more resistance that undermines the original objective.  

Those in ***power*** may be looking for opportunities to apply ***force***, while activists may be looking for inroads to invite *being* ***forced***.  This is the poker standoff that has existed in movements in the United States for over two centuries.  

may achieve momentary compliance, but over the long term, they often collapse or generate resistance that ultimately undermines the original objective.

 everaging it may become disaffected with the outcome produced by ***force***—
