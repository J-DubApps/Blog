Our Backlog Maintenance Meetups generally take place Tuesdays and Thursdays.  This meeting is fast-paced and focuses only on our BACKLOG Lane and Task Assignment activities.  Larger and more complex Tasks, needing deep discussion or Work Breakdown sessions, get discussed last. 
Also known as a Backlog Refinement Meeting or a Backlog Grooming Meeting, this is a regular meeting in Agile and Scrum methodologies where we perform Backlog Triage and review and prioritize the Task Requests in our BACKLOG.
 
During the BMM the Team, Kanban Board Admin, and Project Manager (who may also be a Kanban Board Admin) will discuss as many Tasks as we can in the allotted time (and any user story or ITSM Ticket it relates to) in our BACKLOG.  Sometimes a Task Stakeholder may also attend to provide input or answer questions, but generally this is rare. 
 
We review each Task's description or request, and verify it has "The Three Things" needed to be a valid/Actionable Task.  We then apply Value Management and other acceptance criteria, and (if possible) the estimated level of effort.
 
Any Team members attending may ask questions at this meetup to clarify any uncertainties or dependencies, and provide feedback on the Task or User Story's feasibility and potential Risks.
 
The Team may also discuss any new User Stories or features that they think should be added to the backlog based on feedback from users or stakeholders. Additionally, they may re-prioritize existing user stories based on changing business needs or project requirements.
 
The output of the BMM is a refined Backlog that reflects current Project priorities, SysOps System Mgmt Task progression, and tracking of non-Emergency Service Desk Escalations.  Tasks will have updated user stories and acceptance criteria, if needed, and be estimated and sized appropriately.
 
The goal of Backlog refinement is to ensure that the IT team has a clear understanding of what needs to be done, and that the highest priority items are at the top of the Backlog, so that the team can plan their work accordingly.
 
Final Note: Any Task reviewed during BMM that requires Work Breakdown into > 4 Sub-Tasks may begin to "look like a Project" to us.  In such cases, these Tasks Requests are removed from the Backlog and forwarded to our PM for further review.  The "Task" will either: 1. be returned to the Backlog after PM review, or 2. be converted into a Proposed Project for additional approval and scoping processes by the PM. 
 
Without frequent Backlog Maintenance Meetings and DSU meetings, the Kanban board and process will fail.  These activities are the lifeblood of any functional Scrum or Kanban process.

A properly-attended Kanban board will always communicate general "Status" of all Tasks via its Lanes, making it possible for BMM and DSU meetups to run smooth and fast!
