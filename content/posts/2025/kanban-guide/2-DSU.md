Using Kanban usually requires employing an Agile or Scrum process, and this all starts with our Daily Stand-Up (DSU).  This is a very short meeting, usually no longer than 15 minutes, with no in-depth topics allowed --- Daily Stand-Ups are minimally-conversational and utilize a narrow Kanban Task terminology and, and DSUs only focus on one thing: Task Review and work-planning for that day and nothing else. 
 
We identify the highest priority Blocked Tasks and IN PROGRESS Tasks and discuss those Tasks so that the PM or a Kanban Board Admin might help remove any hurdles.  And lastly we discuss Tasks in the ICE BOX and TESTING QA Lanes for prioritizing based on those Tasks' Priority or Due Date.
 
And we then work on those Tasks when we are not performing other work, or participating in meetings.  Then we hold another DSU the very next business day and the cycle repeats.  We use our DSUs to manage Task Progression and avoid "The Four Horsemen" of Task Apocalypse! :)

Daily Stand-Ups are always very short in duration, with a strict limited and narrowly focus topic of Active Tasks only  (Tasks that are on Active Status Lanes of the Kanban Board).   We do not discuss Tasks in BACKLOG, only: any Tasks that might be Blocked, which Tasks might require assistance in separate break-out sessions (or Swarm Task Work meetups for Urgent or Emergency Tasks), and the general plan for that Day's work goals with each person's Task work.
 
Note: Task "Sprint" period is daily, but certain Task Types may eventually allow for Weekly Task Sprints in the future (e.g. Task work on Project Deliverables). 
 
DSUs are technically not mandatory attendance, because we are all professionals committed to doing our best work and we assume that: if you cannot attend a DSU, you clearly have other matters to attend to, are on PTO, or have a meeting conflict.  So you have latitude to elect to miss a DSU. But we also assume that: you will circle back and re-sync in an upcoming DSU in the near future.
 
All we are talking about is 15 minutes of your day, so we assume making DSUs with some regularity will not be an issue.  We have 5 DSUs a week, at the same time of day, so plenty of opportunity to re-sync.  If you cannot attend a DSU or two, it’s ok.  We do, however, expect everyone to try and keep at least two or three (2-3) DSUs a week (does not to be consecutive).  
 
Example: you are heads-down and in-Flow on a Task presently in the IN PROGRESS Lane on the Kanban Board. If pausing that Task is difficult then we don’t want you in that day's DSU unless you are Blocked or struggling on that Task.  Then you need to attend and make known your Blocks or needs.
 
Note: Team members who do miss more than 7-10 consecutive DSUs, and are not out on PTO, will be contacted by a Manager and may have their Tasks Reverted or Re-Assigned.
 
Without Backlog Maintenance Meetings and DSU meetings, a Kanban board and process will fail.  These activities are the lifeblood of any functional Scrum or Kanban process.
