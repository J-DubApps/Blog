Task Prioritization Definitions & Key
 
Task Urgency Classifications / Prioritizations



TASK PRIORITY GUIDELINES
 
First Task Priority guideline to remember is this: the word "Backlog", and the queued items within in it, is not a negative term.  In Kanban the BACKLOG Lane is merely a bucket, or place, where we can keep an eye on all known INPUTS from other parts of the IT Department.  We review the BACKLOG twice a week to confirm priorities and Assignments on Tasks.  A healthy Backlog should often have many entries, and should never be expected to be totally empty: so the BACKLOG Lane is not always a good indicator of a team being over-subscribed (or underutilized).  The BACKLOG Lane can, however, be a decent indicator of overwhelm in Task Management processes, and can indicate the need to expand Scrum Backlog Maintenance and Task Assignments.
  
The data-entry of putting Tasks into this Kanban board ( INPUTS ) is begun by placing a Task into the BACKLOG Lane.  Anyone in the IT Department can technically submit a Task onto our Kanban BACKLOG Lane for review & assignment.  Normally only an IT Manager, our Project Manager, or SysOps team member will Assign the Task for exiting the BACKLOG Lane.
 
Examples might be Bruce Hatch emails a request to Network Engineers email group, but also enters a Task into the BACKLOG Lane for Review & Assignment.  Another example might be if our Project Manager Larry Taylor needs to assign an upcoming Project related Task to a specific SysOps team member, as a Resource for that project Task.  Tasks can go into the BACKLOG lane as unassigned, and then be assigned and prioritized subject to IT Manager or PM discretion. 
 
When self-entering your own Task, and assigning that Task to yourself, bear in mind that the Kanban Board Admin (Julian) may check-in with you on Task details if you did not enter any on the Task.  Enter as much detail as you can on the Task.  Keep the Task name short and use the Notes and Comment fields on the Task to provide details on what the Task is set to accomplish.  You can also add a Checklist for any multiple-step Task. 
 
Any IT Manager or Service Desk Escalation can redirect you away from a Tasks, self-entered or not,  from time-to-time (we don't always get to pick & choose our Tasks!).   If you're redirected to another Task, you would simply drag your self-entered Task item over to ICE BOX for parking.  Remember: a Task  that is an Escalation from the Service Desk regarding an urgent end-user or Downtime event (with an ITSM Ticket assigned) will bypass ALL Kanban Lanes and go directly into the EMERGENCY Lane.
 
Task entries should have a short descriptive name.  The name can be a clearly-stated outcome or goal (what is needed, what is the Deliverable that we're completing for someone) but the name needs to be short and succinct.  The Task Name itself is not the place to write Task detail info, just brief short name, while using the Task Notes field for additional details.  Include Escalation and ITSM Ticket information (if applicable).  NOTE: An Task entry may have multiple-steps, or Sub-Tasks, but it should always be a single Task. If the task needs to be split into multiple separate Tasks (e.g. tracking multiple steps is not enough) then have the Kanban board Administrator (Julian) review and modify the Task.  A Task entry with a large number of steps and multiple outcomes are Projects, and therefore should not be placed here without first contacting our Project Manager or Bruce Hatch for direction.
 
Tasks default to Moderate priority when entered. Task priorities  may be revised by the Kanban Board Administrator (Julian) or the PM from time-to-time. Other IT Managers and our Project Manager can enter Tasks at any priority.  Tasks can adjust in priority as each individual Task moves across the Kanban board, as well (e.g. ICE BOX Lane will automatically re-set a Task priority to Low -- because all other Task Priorities are not allowed to park there). 
 
The Kanban board allows the SysOps team and our PM to keep an active-view of current, upcoming, and on-hold Tasks, which can help each of us preserve Flow and progress on active Tasks.  Tasks (and priorities of those Tasks) can change from day-to-day, and week-to-week.  Kanban allows our team too operate a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment cadence (CI/CD) for System and Software updates, while also being able to deal with any Interruptions or Escalations that might occur.
