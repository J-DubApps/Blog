Task Prioritization Definitions & Key
 
Task Context Prioritizations




TASK CONTEXT PRIORITY GUIDELINES
 
In addition to a Task Urgency Classification and Due Date for Prioritization, sometimes a Task should also be prioritized based on other factors such as: where the Task work is performed, by who, and if it requires Team tasking (Collaborative or full Swarm) to get the Task completed.  We deal with these additional conditions in Context Prioritization.
