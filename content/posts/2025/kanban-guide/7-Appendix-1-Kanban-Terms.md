APPENDIX I

Understanding the Language of Kanban: A Comprehensive Glossary

1.	Kanban Board
	•	The most visible part of Kanban: a board that shows tasks arranged to reflect stages of work (e.g., “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done”). Digital versions can be found in tools like Trello, Jira, or Azure DevOps, while physical boards typically use sticky notes on a whiteboard.

2.	Column / Lane
	•	The vertical (or horizontal) segments on your Kanban board representing different workflow stages. Examples: “Backlog,” “Development,” “Testing,” “Review,” “Ready for Release,” “Done.”

3.	Swimlanes
	•	Horizontal rows used to categorize work on the same board. Often used to separate different products, priority levels, or types of tasks (e.g., “Expedite,” “Maintenance,” “New Feature”) within a single board.

4.	Work in Progress (WIP)
	•	All tasks that are currently being worked on (in “In Progress” columns). WIP is a key metric in Kanban, as controlling how many tasks are in progress at once helps to maintain a smooth workflow.

5.	WIP Limit
	•	The maximum number of tasks allowed in a column (or across an entire workflow stage) at any given time. By imposing strict limits, teams can reduce context-switching, ease bottlenecks, and maintain focus.

6.	Pull System
	•	A concept where new tasks are only “pulled” into a workflow stage when there’s available capacity. This prevents teams from overloading themselves, increasing flow and efficiency.

7.	Backlog
	•	A collection of all pending work items that have not yet entered the active Kanban board. Items are typically pulled from the backlog to the first column when the team is ready.

8.	Commitment Point
	•	The stage or moment when a team formally commits to start working on a task and deliver it. This is often where a task officially transitions out of the backlog and onto the board.

9.	Done Column (or Done Lane)
	•	The final stage on the board that indicates completed work items. Once tasks land here, they are typically considered closed.

10.	Blocked

•	A status marking that a task is stuck and cannot move forward due to dependencies, missing approvals, or external constraints. It’s important to clearly visualize blocked items (e.g., with a red sticker) so the team can address issues quickly.

11.	Cycle Time

•	The time it takes for a work item to move from the moment it is pulled into the workflow (the “In Progress” stage) until it is done. Cycle time is measured per item, helping teams gauge how quickly tasks are completed once they begin.

12.	Lead Time

•	The total time from the moment a request is made (or added to the backlog) until the task is completed. Lead time takes into account waiting in the backlog plus active time in progress.

13.	Throughput

•	The number of tasks or items completed within a specific time period (e.g., five user stories per week). Tracking throughput helps teams forecast future capacity.

14.	Flow

•	The steady progression of work items through all the stages of the Kanban board. A smooth flow means tasks are neither stalled nor stuck, and capacity is well-managed.

15.	Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)

•	A graphical representation of work in each state over time. It provides insights into how quickly items are moving, bottlenecks, and overall consistency of the flow.

16.	Class of Service (CoS)

•	A classification system for prioritizing work items based on urgency or business impact. Examples include “Expedite,” “Fixed Date,” “Standard,” or “Intangible.” Each class may have different WIP limits or policies.

17.	Expedite Lane

•	A swimlane or process path reserved for highest-priority tasks that must be completed urgently. Expedite items often bypass normal WIP limits.

18.	Policy

•	Rules or guidelines that define how work is pulled, when tasks are considered “done,” and other process constraints. Policies are typically posted directly on or near the Kanban board for transparency.

19.	Service Level Expectation (SLE)

•	A statement that describes how quickly the team aims to deliver certain types of work. For instance, “80% of items under Standard Class of Service will be finished within 10 days of commitment.”

20.	 Cadence

•	The rhythm of regular meetings or reviews—such as daily stand-ups, weekly or monthly retrospectives, and quarterly reviews. Cadence helps maintain continuous improvement and keeps stakeholders aligned.

21.	Operations Review

•	A periodic (often monthly) meeting that looks at metrics such as throughput, WIP, and lead times, focusing on higher-level improvements to the system and the organization’s delivery flow.

22.	Stand-up (Daily Kanban Meeting)

•	A short daily meeting used to synchronize and discuss any blockers. Unlike Scrum stand-ups focusing on a “what I did, what I’ll do, blockers” format, Kanban stand-ups often revolve around the status of tasks in each column, ensuring smooth flow.

23.	 Retrospective

•	A session for the team to reflect on what’s working well, what’s not, and how to improve. Retrospectives can be held at regular intervals or after significant milestones.

24.	 Kaizen

•	A Japanese term meaning “continuous improvement.” Kaizen is deeply ingrained in lean methods, urging teams to regularly look for ways to optimize processes, reduce waste, and improve efficiency.

25.	 Definition of Ready / Definition of Done

•	Borrowed from Agile/Scrum, these definitions detail what must be true for an item to be considered “ready” to pull in or “done” when it’s completed. Having clear criteria reduces ambiguity and helps maintain quality.
