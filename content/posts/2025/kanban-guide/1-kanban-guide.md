The Systems Operations Kanban Board is a Task Management Tool intended to help us visualize incoming work, focus on work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or Flow - see Appendix for definition). 
 
With daily shifting priorities and escalations that our IT Team experiences, Task Management must be malleable and allow for changing priorities and other factors to be managed without affecting Task work and productivity.  Kanban allows Tasks be visible to the Team and, if necessary, to be efficiently paused then resumed in short-order without losing momentum (see Task Switching).
 
To be moving-the-needle on Tasks and completing them, you need a system that allows people to Pivot between Tasks of changing priorities and interruptions, and for Managers and our PM to Triage new Tasks as they become known.  All while being assured In-Progress Tasks are not abandoned or slowed in the noise of day-to-day IT.  
 
Kanban is one system that addresses the above challenge, and it is the system the SysOps Team has adopted.
