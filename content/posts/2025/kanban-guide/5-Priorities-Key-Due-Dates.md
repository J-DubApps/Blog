Due Dates can create Task Resource contention in a small team our size, therefore:
please fully-consider the Task's true needed due date and time line requirements, and consider your Task's "Float" (the amount of time you have before another Task or Project Deliverable are impacted by delayed work on the Task) before setting a Due Date.
 
Due Dates are not set (or required) by default when a Task is created, and Due Dates are generally discouraged on Medium and Low Priority Projects in favor of Task Prioritizations.   If a true "done" date is not yet known by the Task Stakeholder (person submitting the Task to the BACKLOG Lane of the Kanban Board). 
 
Instead, Task Urgency Classification and/or Context Priority are preferred in lieu of a Due Date, where feasible.  This allows the SysOps team and Task Stakeholders to clarify Task Prioritization easier during Daily Stand-Ups and Backlog Maintenance Meetings.  But if a Due Date for the work is known, by all means absolutely enter a Due Date atg Task creation.
 
Please note: Tasks with only Due Dates, and without an Urgency Classification set, will still compete with other Tasks that have a Priority set, and vice-versa.  Due Dates alone do not function well in Kanban, and so all Tasks with a Due Date must also have a Priority set on a Task!  By default Tasks receive a Medium priority, and if the Due Date is far in the future it may be re-classified to a Low Priority Task by the Kanban Board Administrator if there are other Tasks at-hand with earlier Due Dates.
 
Tasks with a Due Date and Urgency Classification set by the Task Stakeholder (creator of the Task) get equal time and receive full review in each Backlog Maintenance Meeting and get discussed at Daily Stand-Up.
