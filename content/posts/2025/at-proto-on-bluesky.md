As a continuation of [**my post the other day about Protocols as a better design approach than Platforms**](https://julianwest.me/Blog/protocols-not-platforms/), I want to offer more details about *how* AT Proto and Bluesky ***work***. <br />




***tl;dr*** **of the above**: Each individual Bluesky user gets their *own* personal database that stores their likes, comments, and so forth (PDS).  By defaut Bluesky creates/hosts and registers that personal database with the Bluesky server, which fetches your data and merges it with everyone elseâ€™s to generate your feed.  Your able to, however, have your personal database live just about *anywhere* of Bluesky's infra: giving you total control of your "*identity*" and social media activity.
