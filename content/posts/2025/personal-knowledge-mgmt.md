Most "Productivity Hacks" and systems are just...Disguised Procrastination.

Endless tweaking, instead of DOING. This is especially true of using note-taking apps as a Personal Knowledge Mgmt System. We've all been there, buying Omnifocus or some similar app for the 10th time--only to tweak for days and days, and getting behind or never getting their benefit. Most PMs have fallen into that trap, before, and it's just as bad with notes apps these days.

There are a 100 note-taking apps out there, and still another 100 "systems". Be done with having a million sub-folders and "curating" endlessly. If you can't not productivity done with tagging, you're unlikely to ever get it done...

For me, I just use default apps, and bend them to my will so that I am not endlessly "refining". I only use the minimal "default" available note apps on the platforms I live on: Apple Notes and Microsoft OneNote. For Apple, I've always done a simplified version of what I'm told is similar to "Forever Notes" - which recently came out. So if you MUST have something "point the way" -- this is a good system. 

But WHATEVER you do, if you're needing a notes & PMKS system -- just get to the "do" part fast. If you're tweaking for more than a couple days on a "system" -- you're stuck. Endless tweaking doesn't move anything forward. Movement is action, and tweaking isn't "moving". /rant off
