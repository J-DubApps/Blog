Whichever your political persuasion, each political majority gets its day in the sun (their period in power)—and the US pendulum swings, in its usual unpredictable cycle, to "move the sunshine" to the political minority. That's the whole ballgame in US politics, *usually*. But when it comes to the two Tesla vehicles I have owned, instead of a pendulum I received *vandalism* as indicators of our national political conversation.  And [apparently other Tesla owners are experiencing the sam](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/business/elon-musk-tesla-violence-protests-vandalism.html).

In October 2015, I parked my Tesla Model S in a regular open lot only to find later that someone had keyed its side. A hastily scrawled note was left behind: "electric cars suck." At the time, this felt like an attack rooted in a pro-oil (or pro-Detroit) and anti-electric vehicle sentiment—a frustration expressed a lot in conservative media between 2008 and 2018, when it came to the change represented by EVs.  Tesla wasn't very popular with the Big 3 and other car companies (including several that had just come through bankruptcies), and the brand was still very new.  When I eventually sold my Model S, I had fixed the keying injury—but remained fascinated at how that could even happen.  

Fast forward to February 2021, and again my Tesla—this time my Model X—fell victim to the same vandalism. Captured by the car's Sentry footage, this time it was a young student (presumably—I was parked in a garage on UT Austin campus) whose face was obscured by a hoodie and mask. They acted the same as the other party several years earlier, but *this time* for obviously different reasons: their actions driven not by hostility to electric vehicles, but by disdain for Elon Musk and his increasingly-polarizing stances. I only say that because my Model X was then keyed a *second time* two years later!!

What fascinates me is not the damage itself—I'd rather *understand*, than harbor anger or resentment. No, what fascinates me is how a single car brand has been (in two different politcal eras) a huge lightning rod for starkly divergent and tribal political aims. It captures something unique about our current cultural moment: the intensity of political identification, and how it attaches itself to products we consume.  

Elon Musk's journey—from celebrated green-tech visionary to ultra-conservative political backer—is certainly not missed by any Americans. His reshaping of Twitter—and spending $288 million in the 2024 Presidential campaign—highlights how quickly public perceptions can swing.  Musk's political stances and social media controversies of the past 4 years have turned Tesla, a brand once synonymous with progressive innovation, into a complicated cultural symbol that is simultaneously embraced and rejected by opposite ends of the US political spectrum.  

And for owners who originally just *liked* the car?  **Let's just I might intimately understand how a German Volkswagen bug owner must have felt in late 1945**. Brands inevitably carry the weight of human decisions and controversies—yet history shows that even deeply tarnished brands might eventually recover and redefine their identities.  

Perhaps in time, Tesla might also find itself clear of history and political crossfire, but I feel that's a long time away: and only possible once they shake their CEO.

I may be moving on to try other EVs in the future, but they were decent cars.
