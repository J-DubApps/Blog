In the past few months I managed to shed about 30 pounds.  I only know that because I started tracking it 3 months in.  You see, my goal hasn't been *weight loss* so much as wanting to just be healthier.  After one too many back doctor visits, and less-than-stellar bloodwork recently, I decided to make a few changes.  So far, it's working.  But I have lost weight before, only to see it eventually return.  This time, I am going to really try and lock-in a *s-l-o-w* path to a healthier me.  And the weight part has been more side-benefit, instead of the main event. <br />

No, this is not another one of those January weight-loss blog posts.  The only thing more annoying to me than people talking about their weight-loss are born-again Christians: both are trying to tell you the *Good News*, and usually neither will shut up about it. 

### How It's Going Down... (*The Weight*)

I would love to tell you I hammered out a spreadsheet and meticulously tracked calories and balanced my diet. But, really, it was just more of a gentle decision to swap out every second slice of pizza for an apple, not drinking diet sodas like I used to, and drinking *way more* water.  That's really it. Over and over. Day in and day out.  I am going easy on myself. Basic changes, and incorporating them *s-l-o-w-l-y*. <br /> 

You see, everything in its natural state is [*entropy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_entropy) anyway: without a food source your body would endothermically regulate itself by going after glycogen in your liver, then later exothermic activities like metabolising fat (though you must be careful to not have it go after muscle and protein).  A human body will sustain itself, and this is the delicate dance involved in any dietary weight-loss. And the modern American food industrial complex would have you understand *none* of these things. <br /> 

But losing weight has never been a goal for me, so much as trying to change my relationship to food... <br />

### Heavy-Set as Part of My *Identity*

My relationship to food was always weird: **I won't put too fine a point on it**, and I wouldn't trade my childhood for anything, but I grew-up experiencing episodes of [*Food Insecurity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security) in my youth.  My mother worked very hard and social security benefits after my father died helped, but money was always tight. Towards the end of any given month, food could sometimes get downright scarce. And though I was never *hungry*, the required food-budgeting of poverty (and not having constant-access to abundant food, that many kids take for granted), it really affected my regard for food later in life.

So a bit of food scarcity as a young kid turned me me into this "*clean your plate*" adult. As a consequence, I have lived at some level of slight *overweight* (and sometimes *very overweight*) for most of my adult life. Just from overeating. "*Heavy-set*” was the usual first-descriptor that might pop into someone's head when meeting me. The extra poundage was my best accessory—only heavier, and less sparkly.  I like to think I carried it pretty well.  As well as anybody living a *singularly-American* off-and-on obsese lifestyle. My weight just never mattered much to me. Until it *did*.  <br /> 

Over time I got these little problems here and there with my back, and my knees.  And those extra pounds weren't helping.  They became the “friend” who always borrows money and never pays you back. Not the greatest company to keep as you approach middle-age! <br />

### Quality of Life Over Everything

A recent visit with my back doctor had him telling me "you could gain half an inch in height, and save your L1 through S5, just by losing 15% of your body weight".  That's an easy-sell, but *not* always *easy* to do! <br />  

But it motivated me, and my weight *finally mattered* enough for me to try and do something about it.  And working mostly-remote allowed me to avoid the constant "food in your face" vibe that permates modern office work these days. Of course now that my job hard-convered away from Remote to Hybrid, food in the office will once-again be a bit of a challenge.

When you're as obsese as I was -- 30 pounds can *quickly* and quietly leave the building, giving you a false sense of accomplishment. And it can just as quickly come back.  So I view any weight-loss right now as just a ***waypoint*** along a *long-term path*.  So this post is *not* about any kind of *achievement*.  It's about quality-of-life as I get older.  <br /> 

I haven't even been counting weight lost: I've been letting my doctor's office do that.  I'm just "checking-in" every month or so to see how it's going, because any weight "lost" (when you're trying to just be healhier) is only half the story.   <br />

### The Takeaway

I’m not pretending this is easy for everyone, or that it was zero effort for me.  It wasn't.  I just didn’t *hyper-focus* on it, either. If living longer is a bonus [***DLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downloadable_content) I unlock in this life, great!  But I could also get hit by a bus after publishing this, too, so I try to keep things in perspective. I also found it's *really* important to forgive yourself and not have [toxic self-talk](https://www.verywellmind.com/negative-self-talk-and-how-it-affects-us-4161304) when trying anything new, or trying to figure out healthier habits.  Life is *hard* enough, without that.  <br />

Also I kind of *hate* how I look right now, because I'm at that awkward "*nothing fits*" and "must buy new clothes" phase of this journey.  That's expensive!! <br /> 

This is purely about being able to stand up straight, move with less pain, and hopefully add a little buffer to my total lifespan—just enough to try out 85 new breakfast spots. None of this will happen because I became a health-obsessed gym rat. 

Also, I'm not even *halfway* to where I ultimately need to *get* in order to *lock* all this in: I still need to lose another 15-ish pounds ***and then add*** back another 10-15 pounds of *muscle* just to be able to have a stronger core & weight for the years ahead.  To do that, I *must* get my body to hold (and be happy) at this new set point.  And that will take time. So this whole thing is turning into a multi-year project.  But it's the only way it can succeed for someone like me...going *s-l-o-w-l-y*.  <br />

I just say to myself, "*I want my back to work less, be sturdier, and my knees to handle a full day*" --- and that's enough for me. <br />
