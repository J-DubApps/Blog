[Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski)’s famous adage “_**The map is not the territory**_” comes from his work in [General Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics) (particularly his 1933 book [Science and Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_Sanity)). At its core, the phrase means that our *mental representations* (_**maps**_) of "reality" are not *the same* as the “*actual territory*" of _**reality**_. We use these “*maps*”—**language, concepts, beliefs**—to navigate our world.  But maps are *abstractions*, simplified models that leave out infinite details. This principle has parallels in other philosophies dealing with “*how things occur*” for us, how we form our views, or *any* perception that is *distinct from* _**objective reality**_.

When we describe something in words, or think anything *conceptually*, we create *an abstraction*—akin to a map charting the terrain. No matter how detailed that map, it is _**still not**_ the physical ground *itself*. General Semantics teaches that language is _**generative**_: it doesn’t just *describe events*; it also *shapes* how we *perceive* and *interact with those events*. Because of this, it’s crucial to remain aware that our words and concepts are always simplifying something that is probably more complex (or unknown to us).

We all *understand*, fundamentally, that *reality* exists *outside* of our minds.  But we never stop for a moment, and look at how we *build* our models.  We take in input from our senses, from conversation, from reading—and we formulate our mental models and create our maps—we *experience the world* this way.

We rely on maps every day to manage complexity or simplify things: newspapers, bank statements, or maybe your employer’s policy document. Maps are there to distill complexity, and give you some indication of the lay of the land.  But do things like financial statements of a company, which boil down the complexity of thousands of transactions, tell you anything about what’s going on at the company or if their products or services are any good?  

Reality is inherently complicated, and messy—which explains our desire to simplify it.  It’s what we’ve *always* done as thinkers, religious scholars, and explorers to name a few cartographers. However, if the goal shifts from comprehension to *simplification*, or we confirm our views with "*cartographers*" who only want to influence us, we begin making poor decisions. We forget that a map is, ultimately, a simplification and *not reality*.  **We mistake the map for the territory**.  

### Wait - this isn’t really about *maps*, but about *thinking*, isn’t it?

This is all about staying *open-minded* to new information about "*the territory*".  Relying *solely* on _**maps**_ can get you to the wrong conclusions, so you have to go “*touch grass*”: explore the _**territory**_ as a reality-check—to arrive at the correct conclusion.  What do I mean by this?  

Maps and models are not meant to be static references for eternity; they are meant to be more dynamic tools, and our mental models should be used for *exploration* and testing our assumptions too...*just as much* as we use them for *understanding*.  

So use our maps or models as accurately as possible, we should consider three crucial principles:  

- **Consider the cartographer’s perspective**.  
- **Reality is *THE* the best update to any map**.  
- **Maps** (mental models) **can**  _**shape**_ **territories** (reality)—not the other way around.  

Ego is a cruel master, and we like to think our perceptions *always* align with reality:“*what is*”.  But if we *forget* that our _**Map**_ (mental model) is *only a representation*, we risk [dogmatism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dogmatism), holding onto certain “truths” as if they are the *reality*. We might dismiss nuances or *new data* that contradicts our internal *map*. And when we fail to recognize that other people operate with their *own* “_**maps**_” (interpretations, mental models, etc). If we can avoid those moments of dismissing *new data*, and remember that other people have their own maps and *cartographers*: it can reduce misunderstandings, judgment, and arguments.  

As human beings with powerful minds and language, we should understand we will never experience “*pure territory*” when looking at new information. The work is to keep noticing when we’re mistaking our interpretations for the *only truth*—and stay open to revising our mental *maps*!  Just remember, we are always given *interpretations* (***maps***) of events (news anchors, thought leaders, politicians etc), and you should not conflate those maps with *reality itself* (***territory***).

## The Takeaway

“_**The map is not the territory**_” reminds us that our mental models of the world we live in, are rarely (read: *never*) the same as the actual world *itself*. Our perceptions often can differ from reality, and it’s automatic that we *won’t* notice this. This is why this concept exists, because our conceptual frameworks are not identical to *actual reality* (objectively *what is*).  

This perception/reality mismatch is pretty natural, and is usually pretty harmless.  For example: we can dine on cognitive bias our whole lives, and never be unhappy in the world—and most people *do*.  But when we’re trying to achieve a goal, it isn’t very safe to misunderstand the *map*—for the *actual territory*.

Revising our maps is challenging because it involves reconciling our preferred assumptions with what genuinely exists. 

Throughout our lives, other people offer us *their* maps.  We depend on maps from authorities, commentators, and educators. In these situations, the best course of action is to *choose our mapmakers wisely*—seeking those who are candid, rigorous, and open-minded and are willing to adapt.

The ability to use this map/territory distinction encourages us to see the world *as it is*, not as we *interpret or imagine it*.  So we want to be prepared to adjust our mental maps every so often.  And when choosing maps by other cartographers, be intentional and choose wisely.
