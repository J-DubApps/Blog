[Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski)‚Äôs ‚Äú_**The map is not the territory**_‚Äù comes from his work in [**General Semantics**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics) (and 1933 book [Science and Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_Sanity)). At its core, the phrase "[*The map is not the territory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map‚Äìterritory_relation)" means that our *mental representations* (_**maps**_) of "reality" are not *the same* as the ‚Äú*actual* ***territory***" of _**reality**_ ***itself***. We use these ‚Äú*maps*‚Äù‚Äî**language, concepts, beliefs**‚Äîto navigate our world. **But maps are still only *abstractions*, simplified models that leave out infinite details**. This principle has parallels in other philosophies dealing with ‚Äú*how things occur*‚Äù for us, how we form our views, or *any* perception that is *distinct from* _**objective reality**_.

When we describe something *in words*, or *think* about anything *conceptually*, we create *an abstraction*‚Äîakin to a map charting the terrain. No matter how detailed that map (of "reality" in our heads), it is _**still not**_ the actual physical ground *itself*:

Other frameworks deal with the above concept as well.  For example, Buddhism has a concept called the ‚Äò***two truths***,‚Äô: a distinction between *relative* "truth" (or conventional truth, or our "***map***") and *absolute* **truth** (the world **as it *is***).

The philosophical framework of **General Semantics** teaches that language is _**generative**_: **it doesn‚Äôt just *describe events*; it also *shapes* how we *perceive* and *interact with those events***. Because of this, it‚Äôs crucial to remain aware that our words and concepts are always simplifying something that is probably more complex (or unknown to us).

We all understand, fundamentally, that *reality* (the *territory*) exists *outside* of our minds (and our *maps*).  But we never stop to look at how we *build* our mental models.  We take in input from our *senses*, from *language* (conversation, reading), and from social sources‚Äîthen we automatically formulate our mental models and *create* our maps‚Äîwe *experience the world* this way.  Here's a chart I created to illustrate ‚Äú_**The map is not the territory**_‚Äù:

We rely on maps every day to manage complexity or simplify things: newspapers, bank statements, or maybe your HR policy manual. Maps are there to distill complexity, and give you some indication of the *lay of the land* (who things *are*).  But do things like a financial statement of a company, which boils down the complexity of thousands of transactions, really *tell you* anything about what‚Äôs *going on* inside the company...or if their products or services are *any good*?  To accept that we all have mental models, or "***maps***", means to also understand that they will always be missing details about the "***territory***" they cover.     

Reality is inherently complicated, and messy‚Äîwhich explains our desire to simplify it.  It‚Äôs what we‚Äôve *always* done as thinkers, religious scholars, and explorers to name a few cartographers. However, if the goal shifts from comprehension to *simplification*, we often confirm our views with *other* "*cartographers'*" *maps*. Certain mapmakers (influencers, tv personalities, etc), share *their* maps to push *their take* on the *territory*‚Äîmedia mapmakers especially!  You just want to take care when you see claims by others of "*how it* ***is***", especially if they're paid to encourage you to update *your own map* with theirs. We are always around people trying to influence our views and merge *their map*. If we're not sure about our *own* interpretations and understandings about the *territory*, it's tempting to "get a new map"‚Äîbut caution: we can easily forget that our own mental model (*map*) is, ultimately, a simplification and cannot cover all aspects of the "territory" ("what is so", *reality*). There are a lot of great resources we use to adjust our own maps‚Äîbut if we're not *careful* **we can** ***mistake*** **the map for the territory**.  We could begin making poor decisions on unexamined *map data*‚Äîand the GPS could drive us off a cliff!  

### Wait a minute‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt really about *maps at all*, is it?

This is about *thinking* (mental models) and staying *open-minded* to new information about "*the territory*" (objective reality *outside* of our own head)! Relying *solely* on _**maps**_ (our mental model‚Äîand our interpretations etc) can lead us the incorrect conclusions, better to go ‚Äú*touch grass*‚Äù now and then: explore the _**territory**_ as a reality-check. To explore the *territory* is to verify your map and challenge your assumptions.  **The territory *experienced* is *better* than the territory *believed***! What do I *mean by* this?   

**If all you're doing is reading the "*map*", the *territory* (*reality*) can crash into you and coldly trash your "*map*"**!  Maps and models are *not* meant to be static references for eternity; they are meant to be more dynamic tools, and our mental models should be used for *exploration* and testing our assumptions too...*just as much* as we use them for *understanding* and navigating the *territory*. 

**To use our maps or models as accurately as possible, we should consider three crucial principles**:  

- **Consider the cartographer‚Äôs perspective** (and motivations, sometimes).  
- **Reality is *THE* the best update to *any* map**.  
- **Maps** (mental models) **can** _**shape**_ **territories** (reality) for us‚Äîand we need to learn that sometimes can have it the *other way around*.    

Ego is a cruel master, and we *like to think* that our perceptions *always* align with reality: ‚Äú*what is*‚Äù.  I am sorry to report that most of us *really* ***love to feel we are correct***.  üòÇ  We *forget* that our _**map**_ (mental model) is *only a representation*, we risk [dogmatism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dogmatism): holding onto certain ‚Äútruths‚Äù as if they are the *reality*. We might dismiss nuances, reject *new raw data*: Fear and Ego like to shoot down *anything* that contradicts our internal ***maps***. When we fail to recognize that other people operate with *their own* ‚Äú_**maps**_‚Äù (interpretations, mental models, etc), things can get a little intense. *Remembering* that our ***map*** *might not* match the ***territory*** reduces misunderstandings, judgment, and helps you keep an open mind.  

As human beings with powerful minds and ***language***, we should understand that we can never experience ‚Äú*pure territory*‚Äù‚Äîwe're *always* experiencing the ***map***.  Our task is learning to notice when we‚Äôre mistaking our mental model as being absolute *truth*‚Äîand stay open to revising our mental *maps*!  Other "*cartographers*" vie for our attention (news anchors, thought leaders, politicians etc) and we can conflate another's ***map*** data with our own (and *reality itself*), thus distorting actual ***territory***. Some people may be good *mapmakers*, just be wary of anyone saying their ***map*** gives you actual *objective reality*‚Äîthe *raw data* of the ***territory***: nobody can do that, but you *yourself*! As I said before: **The territory* *experienced* is *better* than the territory *believed***!

## The Takeaway

‚Äú_**The map is not the territory**_‚Äù reminds us that our mental models of the world *we live in* (and experience) are rarely (read: *never*) the same thing as: the ***actual*** world *itself*. Our perceptions often can differ from reality, and it‚Äôs automatic that we *won‚Äôt* always notice this. *That* is why this concept even exists: our conceptual frameworks are *not* identical to *actual reality* (objectively *what is so* ‚Äî in *reality*).  

This perception/reality mismatch is normal, natural, and can be harmless.  For example: we can dine on cognitive bias our whole lives, and never be unhappy in the world we live‚Äîand most people *do*.  But when we‚Äôre trying to achieve a goal or seize a new opportunity‚Äîit isn‚Äôt very safe to misunderstand the *map*‚Äîfor the *actual territory*.

Revising our ***maps*** can be a challenge at first, because it involves reconciling our *preferred assumptions* with what genuinely (and objectively) *exists in* the ***territory***.  

Throughout our lives we depend on maps from authorities, commentators, and educators. Still other people will offer us *their* maps, as well.  In these situations, the best course of action is to *choose our mapmakers wisely*‚Äîseeking those who are candid, rigorous, and open-minded and are willing to adapt.  Those are the best mapmakers.

The ability to use this map/territory distinction encourages us to see the world ***as it is***, not as we *interpret or imagine it*.  So we want to be prepared to adjust our mental maps every so often.  And when choosing map data by other cartographers, just be *intentional* and choose wisely.
