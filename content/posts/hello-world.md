Hello. My name is Julian West. I just started a blog.<br /> <br />

I don’t really have a plan. Just following my interests and making observations, seeing where it takes me. For now, I’ll leave you with a deep comment on the state of the Personal Blog:<br /> <br />

>“Blogging is not writing. It’s just graffiti with punctuation.”<br /> <br />
