<b>After a uniquely crummy 39th summer in 2013, I have a few thoughts about this psychological waypoint in my life...</b> <br />

-I have breathed air on this planet for approximately 14,600 days, 350,400 hours, and some odd 21 million minutes.
-The words “middle-aged” now invite a whole new concept in my head.
-Suddenly I am placing my glasses on my head & squinting at the fine-print.
-I don’t care what people think. Not that I ever gave a shit what other people think, but now I really don’t care or get embarrassed by much.
-My 20s flew by and all my stupid mistakes and behaviors are now stories I tell.
-I did all my stupid stuff before the Internet. Take that Millennial generation.
-My 30s — where the hell did they go? How do I slow down this ride?!
-My back hurts.
-My Chuck Taylors that I wore on and off for the past 35 years may be causing flat feet. I need to find out how Chris Cannon and Eric Neal survived this. Speaking of shoes…I have shoes older than some people I know.
-Women under 35 address you as “sir” or “mister”.
-This is when they aren’t looking through you. Single or not, you no longer got game.
-I actually read my 401k statements now.
-Stretching is something you now do whether you’re going to exercise or not.
-Speaking of stretching, my back hurts.
-Doctor’s give you crazy drugs when you’re 40. Statins: yuck! Tramadol: ooohh!
-You actually DO care about your lawn now.
-I have actually stopped taking my health for granted and, as a result, may be on track to being in the best shape of my life. Irony.
-Speaking of irony, clothes I wore in high school are now worn by Hipsters.
-I stopped thinking that I can, or should, change anyone’s mind about anything.
-My back really does hurt. I wish I were kidding.
-I feel more fortunate to have accumulated good friends in my lifetime. A beer with good friends is more interesting to me than anything else.
-I turn down the stereo more than I turn it up.
-I have absolutely no clue what is on TV these days.
-It’s a known fact that accumulating birthdays will one day result in death — eventually you don't feel like counting them.  Or making lists like this. Do it anyway.

<b>Here’s to 40, and whatever the next decade brings...</b> <br />
