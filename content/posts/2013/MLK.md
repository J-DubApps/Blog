So today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</a> was sworn in for term # 2, and I want to agree with the talking heads on TV who say that country has come a long way.  But then I see things that show me: we haven't come all that far.<br />  

Irrespective of today’s event, we just aren't all that far from how it was 40 or 50 years ago.<br />

It weighs. <br />

I adopted a tradition from an attorney friend, of re-reading and sharing the “<b><i>Letter from a Birmingham Jail</i></b>” on MLK day. I think it’s the single best education anyone can get on exactly who Dr. King was, and strived to be. <br />
