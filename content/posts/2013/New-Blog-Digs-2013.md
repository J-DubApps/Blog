I moved my domain & content from <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace 5</a> over to Squarespace 6. Basically “across the hall”, in server terms. Much more flexible CMS and template system, allowing me to customize or code my own add-ons. I think I’m gonna like it here. Much respect to the Squarespace team on a job well done. I wholly recommend them for anybody wans to publish a professional looking site, but doesn’t have the skill or money to do so.<br />

Oh, and sorry to any RSS feed readers who got spammed with old posts when I imported them.<br />
