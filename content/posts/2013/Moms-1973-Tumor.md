Somewhere in February or March 1973 my mother, Joy West, went to her doctor with some complaints.<br />

She was 43 years old, and concerned about nausea and some pain in her stomach.<br />

The nausea and pain was so bad she and my dad (in their 40s) worried that it could be the "Big C".  She convinced herself it was something really bad.<br />

But instead of cancer... her doctor informed her that the "tumor” was none other than <i>yours truly.</i><br />

After being married for 20 years and giving up on kids, declared infertile by 1950s doctors who understood next-to-nothing about fertility, she was expecting. It’s fair to say that she and my father were pretty shocked.<br />

I showed up a few months later on September 4th. A Tuesday, but Mom likes to joke how labor started on Monday night, or, Labor Day. Mom and dad got an extended weekend holiday that year.<br />

Today, mom is 83 years old. She may be in declining health, but she is hanging in there and enjoying life.<br />

Yep, my mom thought I was cancer. And her 1973 tumor is about to mark 40 years old later this year.<br />

Life, man...what a trip.<br />
