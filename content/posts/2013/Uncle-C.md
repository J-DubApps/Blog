Today he needed to have an urgent surgery with very short notice.  After doctors "saw something" after a scan.<br />

Family have been texting me updates all day. I am in shock.<br />

After this just happened last year, with my mother-in-law, I just can't think right now.  I am just going to drive over to Tyler and see him when he wakes up. <br />

I haven't always been the praying type, but I am praying hard right now. <br />

My uncle Claude West is the toughest person I have ever known. If anybody can beat something like this, itâ€™s him. <br />

Hang in there uncle C, I love ya and will see you soon.<br />
