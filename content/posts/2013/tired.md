While getting a break this July 4th holiday from work, I just realized this summer means I have worked in tech (in some form or another) for <b><i>20 years</b></i>. That is two decades of various projects, rollouts, and all manner of random tech knowledge worker activities. <br />

I have never felt old, really, but today upon realizing the above?  I feel kind of <i>old</i>. And <i>tired</i>.<br />
