Drove my aging 3-Series to Texas Motor Speedway for a public test-drive event. Not a bad car. Tons of technology built-in and with my own work-commute, I would be one of those who only visits the gas station every month or two.<br /> <br />

2013 model comes out in Aug/Sept â€” this may offend my anti Detroit bailout friends, but I may just have found my next car.
