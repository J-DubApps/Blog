It’s been nearly three years since I wrote a series of posts about giving up my 3-series for a 2012 Chevy Volt, and in about that time I have enjoyed a gas-less commute to work. In the last 2 and a half years I only stop at convenience stores for, well, convenience things (soda, chewing gum, etc). The gas pump and me just don’t hang out that much anymore.<br /> <br />

As I’m looking towards my next EV this year, I started looking at other options to trade-into including the <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/bmw/i3">i3</a>, <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/LEAF%E2%80%8E">Nissan Leaf</a>, and even (<i>gulp</i>) the <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-s">Teslas Model S</a>. And along comes Chevy with <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/12/7530817/2016-chevy-volt-rolls-out-at-the-north-american-international-auto-show">a brand-new Volt model.</a><br /> <br />

While the i3 has greater range than my 2012 Volt, it’s also very small. It runs about $46k with everything you’d probably want (including range-extender). The Model S is sporty and roomy (like a 5-series) and runs about $75k with the 60kw battery option, and far more with tech package, Supercharging, etc.<br /> <br />

While the Model S is by far the best EV out there, I’m not really in the market for that right now and I really want to see what comes after the Model X. Tesla’s model-iteration is very slow and deliberate (they’re on a mission to change how we look at cars, and they’re succeeding). So my next car was planned to tide me over during that wait. But today Chevy again showed up with something special, and makes a compelling case to stick with them as the <a href="http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-chevrolet-volt-plug-in-hybrid-official-photos-and-info">2016 Volt</a> debuted today at the Detroit Auto Show, with a release date pegged somewhere in late summer.<br /> <br />

I like the design of the new Volt. Yes the body style has a bit of a Honda/Acura vibe to it, but I think it’s a more appealing look and welcome departure from the original body style for the average buyer. Yet this revised car really echoes the original Volt’s look when viewed from the side. Under the hood, the engineering changes are numerous and all the numbers trend in the right direction: up to 10 more miles per charge, 5 more mpg for the engine (which takes regular octane unleaded gas now), and faster acceleration. What’s more, the dashboard now looks a LOT easier to use and has a better layout: separate araea with knobs for the AC controls, and they did away with the “soft touch” button console stack. Apple CarPlay is also supported, which is nice.<br /> <br />

The timing for the a new release isn’t ideal, since new Volt shows up when the price at the pump is the lowest in years, but we all know how stable oil pricing isn’t. Also, most people buying EVs these days aren’t doing so with a mind towards saving money on fuel anyway. If you look at the price and fun epic sporty driving experience of a Tesla, <i>not using gas</i> is simply a featureo or side-benefit for people who can afford cars in the Model S’ price range. Most people who buy into this technology have reasons other than the price of oil, but just wait when the next spike comes.<br /> <br />

I think it’s great that we have so many options of EV technology these days, and although that Model S is mighty tempting I think I (and my pocket book) have been sold on Volt II for the next few years. Same color as mine now, red with some manner of two-tone leather interior. I’ll write more about that later this summer when I start looking.
