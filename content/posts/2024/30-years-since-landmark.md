It's now been ***15 years*** since I [wrote about my 1994 experience with "***The Landmark Forum***"](#landmark) on this blog.  **The Forum** is a 3-day (and one evening) educational seminar, run by one of the world's largest for-profit *personal-improvement* companies‚Äî[***Landmark WorldWide***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide).  It remains one of my most top-read posts, in terms of feedback, and even resulted in a brief discussion with a staffer researching it on [a popular FX TV Show](https://julianwest.me/Blog/the-americans-and-landmark/). <br />

The above means, here in 2024, that it has *now* been ***30 years*** (!!) since I attended ***The Landmark Forum***.  <br />

That's *wild*. <br />

I reread [those old blog posts](#landmark) recently‚Äîand while I don't approve of my passive voice writing in 2009 (and I *did* make a few 2024 corrections to it), I have to say my old write-up *still holds-up*! <br />

You know what also *still* holds-up?  Some of those *tools* and distinctions that I acquired, in that dreary conference center 30 years-ago, stuck with me.  <br />

I never *returned* to take additional **Landmark** courses and have only spoken with a few fellow **Forum** graduates and volunteers; *however*, all these years later my recollection is still *crystal*.  Brainwashing?  *Nah*, it's just that some of it was *actually interesting* to me! <br />  

*How interesting*?  Well, I went on to study Philosophy and read some books about **The Forum's** previous form, [***EST***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training), and a book or two about its founder [***Werner Erhard***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Erhard). Why my fascination?  Well, I wanted to *better understand* how Erhard repackaged so many tools and concepts (the *technology*) from the various philosophies that he did. <br />

So I am not going to shill or condemn **Landmark**, *nor* will I ever tell you it's a *cult*; however, to this day I jokingly do call **Landmark** "*Scientology Lite*". Not to be derogatory, just a funny term I picked-up in an online "*forum*". üòÇ Ironically I have actually spoken with ex-Scientologist friends who told me that ***EST*** (and thus, **Landmark**) borrow "*technology*" from it. And if it *does*, it doesn't much *matter* since I believe [***L. Ron Hubbard***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard) *also borrowed* much of *his own* material from well-known Philosophers and Psychiatrists, anyway. ü§∑üèª <br />

I've gone through 30 years of changes since I graduated The **Landmark Forum**, and since the Pandemic [***Landmark WorldWide***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide) went through some changes, too‚Äîa reboot with new leadership.  I guess even personal-devlopment giants go through periods of *growth* like the rest of us.  <br />

So *how well* do I remember these tools, concepts, and distinctions that **Landmark** taught me, 30 years ago?  **Let's find out**!  <br />

I reviewed my old journal notes‚Äîand I just created [**this rough Glossary of Landmark Terms**](https://julianwest.me/Blog/landmark-glossary/) to go along with [my original mini-memoir](https://julianwest.me/Blog/a-funny-thing-happened-after-the-forum-part-1/). I think it is pretty accuarate. If you are a Forum Grad, feel free to write and tell me what you think. <br />
