It's now been ***15 years*** since I [wrote about my 1994 experience with "***The Landmark Forum***"](#landmark) on this blog.  **The Forum** is a 3-day (and one evening) educational seminar, run by one of the world's largest for-profit *personal-developmentt* companies‚Äî[***Landmark WorldWide***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide).  It remains one of my most top-read posts in terms of feedback, and even resulted in a brief discussion with a research PA staffer at [a popular FX TV Show](https://julianwest.me/Blog/the-americans-and-landmark/) in 2017. <br />

The above means, here in 2024, that it has *now been* ***30 years*** (!!) since I attended ***The Landmark Forum***.  <br />

That is *wild*. <br />

I reread [those old blog posts](#landmark) recently‚Äîand while I don't approve of my passive voice style in 2009 (I *did* make a few 2024 corrections to it), I must say I feel like my old **Landmark Forum** review *still holds-up*! <br />

You know what *also still* holds-up?  Some of those *tools* and distinctions that I acquired, in a dreary conference center 30 years-ago‚Äîand so I kept a few of those tools over the years. <br />

I never *returned* to take additional **Landmark** courses, and have only spoken with a few fellow **Forum** graduates and volunteers over the years; *however*, 30 years on my recollection is still *crystal* for much of it.  Brainwashing?  *Nah*, it's just that some of it was *really interesting* to me at the time. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <br />  

*How interesting*?  Well, I went on to study Philosophy and read some books about **The Forum's** previous form, [***EST***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training), and a book or two about its founder [***Werner Erhard***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Erhard). Why my fascination?  Well, I wanted to *better understand* how Erhard repackaged so many tools and concepts (the "*Technology*") from the various philosophies that he did. <br />

So I am not here to shill or condemn **Landmark**, *nor* can I tell you it's a *cult* from my own limited experience of one course 30 years ago; *however*, to this day I do jokingly call **Landmark** "*Scientology Lite*". Not to be derogatory, just a funny term I picked-up in an online "*forum*". üòÇ Ironically I have actually spoken with ex-Scientologist friends who told me that ***EST*** borrowed "*technology*" from it. But that doesn't much *matter*, since I believe [***L. Ron Hubbard***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard) *also borrowed* much of *his own* material from well-known Philosophers and Psychiatrists, anyway (which largely explains Scientology's anti-psychiatry stances). ü§∑üèª <br />

I've gone through 30 years of changes since I graduated The **Landmark Forum**, and since the Pandemic [***Landmark WorldWide***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide) went through some changes, too‚Äî[a bankruptcy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/landmark-worldwide-nears-completion-difficult-020000623.html) and reboot. Apparently (and hopefully) with new leadership.  <br />

So *how well* do I remember these tools, concepts, and distinctions that **Landmark** taught me, 30 years ago?  **Let's find out**!  <br />

I reviewed my old journal notes‚Äîand created [**this rough Glossary of Landmark Terms**](https://julianwest.me/Blog/landmark-glossary/) to go along with [my original mini-memoir](https://julianwest.me/Blog/a-funny-thing-happened-after-the-forum-part-1/). I think it is pretty accuarate. If you are a Forum Grad, feel free to write and tell me what you think. <br />

&#42;**Note:** no offense meant to any happy **Landmark Grads** for the "*Scientology Lite*" nickname. üòâ  I am always open to hearing others' experiences with **Landmark**, good or bad. I also acknowledge that (while my *own experience* was mostly positive) that the organization has problematic aspects, and others have had harmful or negative experiences related to them.
