People who code and automate things (whether it's for a valley tech giant, or a line-of-business pipeline) like to think we're *all that*.  We're really not. <br />

***We’re digital carpenters*** who are paid well only because demand still outstrips supply...and people think what we do is super-complicated wizardry. It’s not - it’s advanced sudoku at best.  <br />

Sure, you *still* need to be smart & build experience to be *good* at it. But coding (while maybe not easily *taught* to humans quickly) is not the *Rain Man + Gandalf* thing many think it is. But *practice* of *making*...of *creating* something useful to people (seemingly out of thin air) will always be nothing short of magic.  That *said*, the tech layoffs of the past 20 months have taught me that coding for automation, site-resilience, and overall operations is becoming... *less* rare in terms of supply.  ***This is due to*** ***AI*** and its rise. <br />

I have always said: **it's not AI that will take your job, it's ***people*** who learned to wield who will take your job.**  And I see a *lot* of junior engineers and non-coders wielding it, for DevOps stuff these days.  <br />

The "wielding it *well*" part isn't here yet, but it's coming. And yes it will scale.  Tech workers using AI with precision and proper risk-management, and a discerning ability to QC the quality of generated outputs, are already *miles ahead* of those who don't. Sorry, it's just facts. <br />

Code may eventually become, mostly for your average company, a *commodity*.  Unless you're an engineer at OpenAI or other big tech shop, and you're coding into pipelines that millions of users depend on (baically, a relative *few*), what you do in dev right now will probably become *less* bespoke in the next few years.  And if you're avoiding AI at all in Enterprise IT and DevOps, eventually "*less bespoke*" becomes "***less in-demand***".  <br />

What we do as coders *is* valued *for the moment* and, for many of us, it's still a ***craft***.  But do mark my words: more and more people will develop published commercial and open source projects coming *not from teams* and sprints, but from a few people and AI-driven deliverables.  So if you've been ignoring AI at all, I really think your own tech career risk doubles or triples.  <br />

That is not to say that AI does *everything* better than teams of humans in *anything*, yet. But when it comes to software engineering -- <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Tech-sector-layoffs-explained-What-you-need-to-know">coders and technical teams are already seeing disruption</a>.  So I think the most important thing you can remember as a DevOps Engineer, Software Developer, or anyone working in automation right now: ***People, not code, are the most important part of your job.***  <br />

Just don't ever get far from the concept that Software is ultimately used by *people*. AI is a people-oriented undertaking, and technology projecs *are*...(you guessed it) *people*.  Keep that as your *high-order bit*, and writing code in the age of AI needn't be a dead-end job.
