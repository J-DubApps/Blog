People who code and automate things (whether it's in the Valley, or for line-of-business) like to think we're *all that*.  We're really not. <br />

We’re digital carpenters who are paid so well only because demand greatly outstrips supply...and people think what we do is super-complicated wizardry. It’s not - it’s advanced sudoku at best.  <br />

You *still* need to be smart at Sudoku, and have decent experienced built-up, to do it really well.  Sure.  And coding is not easily *taught* to humans who aren't into tech.  That *said*, the tech layoffs of the past 20 months have taught me that coding for automation, site-resilience, and over all operations is becoming... *less* rare in terms of supply.  ***This is due to*** ***AI*** and its rise. <br />

I have always said: **it is not AI that will take your job, it's ***people*** who learned how to wield it well.**  And a *lot* of junior engineers and non-coders are wielding it these days.  <br />


The "wielding it *well*" part isn't here yet, but it's coming.  Tech workers who are using AI with proper risk-management, and a discerning ability to QC the quality of AI-generated outputs, are already miles ahead of tech workers who haven't touched AI yet. <br />

Code is going to become, mostly for your average company, a commodity.  Unless you're an engineer at OpenAI, or some other tech company, and you're coding into pipelines that millions of users depend on (baically, relative *few*), what you do in dev right now is probably becoming *less* bespoke.  And if you're avoiding using AI at all in Enterprise IT and DevOps, eventually "*less bespoke*" becomes "***in less demand***".  <br />

What we do as coders still valued.  For many of us, it's still ***craft***.  But as more and more people develop published commercial and open source projects where, instead of a Scrum team, it's a few coders prompting/debugging and an AI: if we're ignoring AI, we're creating a world of risk for ourselves.  <br />

That is not to say that AI will do everything as well as teams of humans, in *anything*, but when it comes to software engineering -- coders and teams are already seeing disruption.  So I think the most important thing you can remember as a DevOps Engineer, Software Developer, or anyone working in automatio right now: ***People, not code, are the most important part of your job.***  <br />

Just don't ever get far from the concept that Software is ultimately used by people, AI people-oriented undertaking, and technology projecs *are*...(you guessed it) *people*.  Keep that as your high-order bit, and using AI and delivering coded solutions needn't be a dead-end job.
