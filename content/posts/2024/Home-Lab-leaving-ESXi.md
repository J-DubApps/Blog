Referring to my post from last month, about escaping the inevitable <i><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a></b></i> of a platform, that effort has moved from my blog (<a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/hugo-crash-course/">migrated from Medium</a>)... over to my poor aging HomeLab setup.<br />

With exception of a few Cloud sandboxes in AWS and Azure, I run most of my personal learning / test-dev setups here at home on a couple of beefy mini servers.  They actually run in my garden shed which has cooling, advanced smoke detection -- but the main benefit is no noise in the house. A big no-no for the Mrs. <br />

So while I am using my HomeLab servers less of late, I do still often need to spun-up a Docker instance or a VM to quickly put something through its paces.  But developments in the past two years has my HomeLab facing the afforementioned challenge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>.  Here's why that is: <br />

- In the past two years I increasingly do my test-dev / learning stuff in Cloud compute instances. Leaving my servers a little neglected, and ready for a refresh.
- My HomeLab hypervisor, VMWare ESXi, was acquired by <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Broadcom-E6926-RVW75069965.htm">Broadcom</a> who promptly retired educational licenses, shuttered VMWare IT Academy licensing, and erased ESXi standalone licenses.

Broadcom's acquisition has been a <a href="https://www.itbrew.com/stories/2024/04/03/broadcom-ceo-admits-vmware-takeover-has-resulted-in-some-unease-among-our-customers">gouging of epic proportions</a>, and painful to experience with prod environments I support. I won't belabor it, I'll just say this... <br />

VMware under Broadcom is like seeing your favorite restaurant getting bought by a guy who only serves reheated leftovers at triple the price.  Unsurprisingly, everyoneâ€™s looking for a new place to eat. <br />


When it comes to pricing Broadcom is, in a phrase, the kings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> of platforms and products. <br />

To be somewhat generous, Broadcom apparently did have a change-of-heart with VMWare Workstation and Fusion.  But not a fit for most HomeLab folks with 256gb ESXi hosts doing test-dev or SDWAN prototyping. <br />

So I am looking at standardizing on something else.  Probably <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview">Proxmox VE</a> or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/">Hyper-V</a>. <br />

I'm going to be trying both out on two of my mini hosts, which have 4TB SSDs / 256gb of RAM each. If anyone has any other suggestions on a good HomeLab platform beyond the above two options, <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/contact/contacting/">I'm all ears</a>.
