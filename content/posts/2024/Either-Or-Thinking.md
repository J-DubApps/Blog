Consider how you typically make decisions. Do you ever feel you’re forced to choose between only two possibilities—this or that? In reality, you often have far more than two options, yet an either-or mindset can keep you locked into a limited view of what’s possible.

Frederick Carl Frieseke once said, “Your range of available choices—right now—is limitless.” This reminds us that we don’t have to pick between just one or another. Instead, we can explore entirely different paths.

Even so, many of us feel as if we’re backed into a corner with only two doors out, despite our inherently boundless choices. We then mistakenly perceive our options as few.

A Simple Example

During a program I attended (The Landmark Forum), the presenter asked a participant, “If I offer you a vanilla or chocolate ice cream cone, which one do you choose?” That question creates a sense of only two possibilities—vanilla or chocolate. But, in truth, you could select something else altogether. You could opt for pistachio, skip the ice cream entirely, or seek out your own preferred flavor.

Beyond Either-Or

We frequently see this either-or thinking in other areas:
•	“Chocolate chip cookie dough or a fruit bowl?”
•	“Beach house or mountain cabin?”
•	“Cat or dog?”
•	“More joy or more time?”

Sometimes we want both choices, or perhaps neither. Maybe we want a completely different experience. The real trouble arises when we feel forced to pick one option if it’s not genuinely what we want.

Expand Your Choices

Refusing to accept “this or that” frees you to choose something aligned with your true desires—even if you’re not yet sure how you’ll attain it. By letting go of restrictive either-or thinking, you can pick something more fulfilling or create a way to have both (or something else entirely). Committing to what you truly want—combined with believing anything is possible—empowers you to bring that vision to life.

Remember: Not Choosing is Still a Choice

Choosing not to decide can be the biggest obstacle of all. When you refuse to pick anything, you essentially accept that your life remains exactly as it is—no ice cream, no new experience, no meaningful change. If you want something different, you have to choose it, then devote yourself to making it happen.

The key is to avoid settling for the options presented if they’re not genuinely satisfying. With an “anything is possible” attitude, you’ll see your infinite range of choices—and take full advantage of all they offer.
