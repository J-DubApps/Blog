...and he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-brian-thompson-shooting.html">died</a>. <br />

He was murdered. Assasinated.<br />

The killer is at large, and social media is rife with the video and alarming commentary.  The commentary ranges from <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5217736/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-ceo-social-media">venting</a> to indifference, and worse as there have also been gross celebrations of this tragic event. <br />

I don't agree with the dark responses, but I also cannot ignore that claim denials by health insurance companies may have been a factor inspiring this: reporting on the scene states that the words "<i>delay</i>" and "<i>deny</i>" <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-murder-words-written-on-shell-casings/">were written on the bullet casings</a>. That would be a clear reference to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Delay-Deny-Defend-Insurance-Companies/dp/1591843154">this book</a>. It doesn't justify what this murderer did at all, and also two terrible things can be true at the same time: murder is wrong, and some activities health insurance companies engage in, day-to-day, are wrong as well. <br />

Claim denials have always been a fact of life for Insurance the past 30-50 years. But the ACA ultimately failed to eliminate the “I lost my house b/c my 100K heart surgery had to happen…” cycle our population has struggled with.  When they could no longer deny coverage, health insurance companies simply deny claims.  The claim-denial infrastructure (<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hospitals-are-reporting-more-insurance-denials-ai-driving-them-1977706">now AI-driven</a> in some insurance companies) that has arisen in light of Obamacare is massisve. Cutting costs is a mainstay of how companies must function, and how health insurance companies survive under our broken healthcare system in the US. It just cannot be ignored that, after ACA, healthcare companies have become more creative in the pressure to remain profitable.<br />  

I recall in 2010, a lifetime ago, insurance companies lobbyied to convince Americans that socialized health care meant government death panels, deciding who gets treatment: in 2024, our claims-denial industry ended up being essentially that exact thing. <br />

None of that condones what happened this past week at all, by pointing out the reality of our dysfunctional health insurance system I just think it deserves thought while authorities pursue the murderer.  In observing our world as it exists, in reality, maybe it's worth discussing how to fix a healthcare system that has actually gotten <i>worse</i> in the past decade...when we were told by many political candidates it was better.<br />  

I hope they catch and punish the killer.  It was an evil, horrific act. So was hearing about acts of health insurance companies and our claim-denial mini-industry, shoved into the spotlight this week. Two things can be wrong, at the same time.<br />
