...and he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/nyregion/unitedhealthcare-brian-thompson-shooting.html">died</a>. <br />

He was murdered. Assasinated.<br />

The killer is at large, and social media is rife with the video of the assainsation and alarming commentary.  The commentary ranges from <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5217736/brian-thompson-unitedhealthcare-ceo-social-media">venting</a> to indifference or worse, as there have also been gross celebrations of this tragic event. <br />

I don't agree with the common response, but I also cannot ignore that claim denials by health insurance companies may have been a factor (as observed by people much smarter than I).  It doesn't justify what this murderer did at all. Also, two terrible things can be true: murder is wrong. And some activities health insurance companies engage in, day-to-day, may be wrong as well. <br />

Claim denials have always been a fact of life for Insurance the past 30-50 years. But the ACA ultimately failed to eliminate the “I lost my house b/c my 100K heart surgery had to happen…” cycle our population has struggled with.  When they could no longer deny coverage, health insurance companies simply deny claims.  The claim-denial infrastructure (<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hospitals-are-reporting-more-insurance-denials-ai-driving-them-1977706">now AI-driven</a> in some insurance companies) that has arisen in light of Obamacare is massisve. Cutting costs is a mainstay of how companies must function, and how health insurance companies survive under our broken healthcare system in the US. It just cannot be ignored that, after ACA, healthcare companies have become more creative in the pressure to remain profitable.<br />  

I am not choosing sides in this horrible event, btw.  I am just observing our very dysfunctional country. Our world as it exists, in reality.  I hope they catch and punish the killer.  It was an evil, horrific act. So was hearing about acts of health insurance companies, shoved into the spotlight this week. Two things can be wrong, at the same time.<br />
