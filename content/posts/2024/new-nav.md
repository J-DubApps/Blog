So I moved the Blog recently, and re-organized it as well.  Now that I have 80% of my original blog content imported over here and formatted, I wanted to provide visitors a Navigation tips page.  [Go here](https://julianwest.me/Blog/nav-tips/) for some handy shortcuts to move around my blog content.  <br />
