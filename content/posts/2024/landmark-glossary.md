## Preface

<i><b>This page is a companion document to my original 3-part special write-up revisiting my attendance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide#Landmark_Forum">The Landmark Forum</a></b> in 1994, which was originally published to this blog in 2009:<a href="https://julianwest.me/Blog/a-funny-thing-happened-after-the-forum-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://julianwest.me/Blog/a-funny-thing-happened-after-the-forum-part-2/">Part 2</a>, and <a href="https://julianwest.me/Blog/a-funny-thing-happened-after-the-forum-part-3/">Part 3</a></b></i>.  I regularly get asked questions about *word meanings* and *terminlology* from readers of my original 3-part write-up, so that is how this rough *Glossary* was born.  I really have nothing *new* to add about my **Landmark** experience that hasn't already been *said* in those write-ups.  I speak with no authority on this subject, just my own personal unbiased memory. <br />

The terms, phrases, and definitions below are a *modified fork* of the original [Landmartian Glossary - Wiki University](https://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Landmark_Education%2FAbd%2FGlossary&oldid=1963288), a Landmark Graduate-created page no longer maintained and ***not*** endorsed by [Landmark Worldwide](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com). <br />

#### IMPORTANT NOTE:    and definitions on this page are my own work product (using afforementioned resources) and are ***not*** reviewed or approved by [Landmark Worldwide](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com).

## Special Notes

**Special Note 1**: The ***intended audience*** for this page is *limited* ***only to*** **Landmark Forum** ***Graduates*** seeking a refresher, or non-biased/academic researchers. Breezing through these terms may otherwise be confusing (see FAQ](#faq) item #1).  This Glossary is ***not*** to be used, *cited*, or link-referenced by those axes (*or* ***rackets***, haha) to grind with [Landmark Worldwide](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com)!  The *only* points-of-view expressed here are focused *on* the terms from the **Landmark Forum**, for non-biased analysis go to  those from my articles above, or personal unbiased side-notes below. The terms are my own *personal interpretation* of [***The Landmark Forum***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide#Landmark_Forum) technology, sourced from 30 year-old notes and the above-referenced Wiki University page.  Nothing more.  <br />

**Special Note 2 *About The Definitions* And *Why* They're Presented**: Every discipline has its own language, borrowing general terms and providing their own *specific*, *distinct meanings*. We usually call it "***jargon***". **For example**, in **physics** the words "*force*", "*work*", and "*power*" are all given *specific meanings* for mathematical modeling to work consistently. So while "***work***" means ***force through a distance*** in physics, the common term of "***work***" means ***applying effort***, either mental or physical, for any layman. **To a physicist**, however, pressing as hard as you can against a wall and *not moving it* = **no work**; but to everyone else listening to the physicist, it was *possibly* ***a lot*** *of useless work*! That stupid doctor exerted *a lot* of effort to no affect!  **So every discipline has its own language, and** ***so it is*** **with** ***Landmark*** **and why this Definitions page exists**.  **The Landmark Forum's** 3-day course borrows words from *common language*, and gives specific meanings in order to communicate new ideas. Every [**NLP system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming) and [**LGATs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-group_awareness_training) has this trait, and this page sets out to help give definition and context to **The Landmark Forum** terms.<br />

***Personal Side Note***: I of course am familiar with published criticisms of Landmark, how it is an [**LGATs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large-group_awareness_training), how they say that it leverages [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming), etc.  I address those criticisms in my 3-part blog series (mini-memoir) found above under the [**Preface**](#preface) section. This page is not about validating critics, but was created for **Forum Graduates** wanting to revisit the terminology.<br />

The terms, phrases, and definitions below are a *modified fork* of the original [Landmartian Glossary - Wiki University](https://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Landmark_Education%2FAbd%2FGlossary&oldid=1963288), a Landmark Graduate-created page no longer maintained and ***not*** endorsed by [Landmark Worldwide](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com), and *no authorship or ownership* to any material in this Glossary is claimed in *any* way.

## Terminology

**Terms and Definitions here are Landmark Grad-written and *not* endorsed or *approved* by Landmark Worldwide**. *At all*.  This resource is intended to briefly cover the [***Ontology***](#ontology) used by Forum Leaders during the 3-day seminar, by Landmark Forum graduates in the Landmark community.  This page does *not* propose (or state) that any of these definitions are the "correct" *meanings* of Landmark's terminology. *At all*. <br />

Commonly-defined *Terms* get used by **Landmark Worldwide** in *special ways* even after The Landmark Forum course, and sometimes there is confusion. For example, the term "*enrollment*" is officially defined as "*enrolling*" others in a *possibility*, so that they are "moved, touched, or inspired" by any *breakthroughs* that you share with people.  So it does *not* at all mean "*enrolling people into courses*", which is often one of the main misnomers I hear about (the *word* you'd be looking for, for that, is "*Registration*" referring to the context of actually signing up for a course (the generic meaning in the training is *the acceptance of an offered choice*, but it is also used with the ordinary meaning, i.e, action to formally place one's name in a list of "registrants."). <br />

Feel free to write-in definitions for me, if you see something here that needs adjusment or amending.  If you are related to the Landmark Forum, feel free to send brief comments or alternative definitions.

#### IMPORTANT NOTE: These definitions are my own, and have ***not*** been reviewed or approved by Landmark Worldwide.

## Definitions
<a id="act"></a>
<a id="aal"></a>
<a id="advanced"></a>
• <u><b><i>Act</i></b></u>. <small> An ***Act*** is an [***inauthentic***](#authenticity) **way of** [***being***](#being) that someone takes on-often *automatically*-to navigate social situations or personal insecurities.  You can ***act*** in ways that "*make yourself look good*"; or (motivated by [***being right***](#being-right)) a manner you take on for yourself *in furtherance of your own* desired self-image or as part of your [***strong suit***](#strongsuit).  People ***Act*** in accordance to different [***Contexts***](#context), **Example**: we have a professional "*face*", or ***Act***, that we project at our job. **Two further examples**: someone might adopt a “*tough guy*” stance to conceal fear or insecurity, or a “*people-pleaser*” persona to manage anxiety or *avoid conflict*. You may like to [***show up***](#shows-up) for others as an extroverted or outgoing person, but if you're always feeling a need to prove it...it's simply an ***Act***.</small><br />
**Landmark** advocates *acknowledging* where you’re being [***inauthentic***](#authenticity) as a first-step to *becoming aware* of your "***Act***", and ***owning it***: “I realize I’m ***acting*** like everything’s under control, but truthfully I’m *anxious*.” This is a step your journey of ultimately learning how to "*drop your* ***Act***". (covered more deeply in the ***Advanced Course***) "***Dropping the “Act***” means letting others see what’s *real*, even if it’s *uncomfortable* or *unpolished*.  **Landmark** constantly ties [***authenticity***](#authenticity) to “[***integrity***](#integrity)”—having your *words*, *actions*, and *inner states* **align**. When you spot the “***Act***,” the practice is to step into integrity by speaking candidly or taking actions that reflect what’s really so.  <br /></small>
• <u><b><i>Advanced Course</i></b></u>. <small> The next immediate course, which now appears to have become a selection of courses you can choose from.  When I attended The **Landmark Forum**, the immediate second required course was *fixed* as you needed to complate that Advanced Course as part of what Landmark called the "[***Curriculum for Living***](#curriculum)."  I never attended any Landmark courses beyond the original 3-day **Landmark Forum**</small><br />
• <u><b><i>Already always listening.</u></b></i>&trade; <small> Undistinguished *pre-existing interpretations* that shape, color and influence the way people *experience* their relationships with other people, circumstances, and *even themselves*. AAL is that "little voice in your head" that is finishing other peoples' sentences (the voice of your imagination), complete with *baked-in* and *on-the-fly* [***interpretations***](#meaning-machine) and [***stories****](#story) that you're constantly *creating* (even unconciously). Only by *recognizing* whenever you're *doing this*, and *changing your* [***Listening***](#listening), can you break out of the ***Already Always Listening*** and [***Story***](#story) cycles.  AAL one of THE ***major concepts*** in *Landmark*, and managing it is a major goal of The **Landmark Forum**. </small><br />
<a id="at-cause"></a>
<a id="at-choice"></a>
• <u><b><i>Aliveness</u></b></i>.<small> A sense of being ***fully aware***, fully *present* and fully *yourself*.  It is a [**state of** ***being***](#being) that Landmark Forum wants to help you to create for yourself. </small><br />
<a id="at-effect"></a>
<a id="authenticity"></a>
• <u><b><i>At Cause</u></b></i>.<small> Taking responsibility for ***how you experience*** **and** ***respond*** **to events**, believing you can generate new [***possibilities***](#possibility) *rather than* being *limited* by old [*stories*](#stories) or external constraints.  “***At Cause***” is the stance of recognizing *your agency* and power to interpret, respond, and create new [***possibilities***](#possibility) in the face of virtually *any circumstance*. “**Cause**” = You *create* your *experience*. *See also* [***At Effect***](#at-effect).  <br />
• <u><b><i>At Choice</u></b></i>.<small>  In **Landmark** terminology, “***at choice***” broadly means you are consciously *choosing* your actions or perspectives rather than feeling forced, compelled, or constrained by circumstances. To be ***at choice*** means you fully "*get*" the [***distinction***](#distinction) between [***Choosing vs. Deciding***](#choose-decide), and be in the stance of recognizing you can *choose* your perspective or actions. When you are ***at choice***, you are able to be ***at cause*** and *uneffected* by circumstances.  *See* ***At Cause*** prior to this term, and ***At Effect*** in the following term.
• <u><b><i>At Effect</u></b></i>.<small> Feeling that you are *at the mercy of* (or “*victimized by*”) external events, other people’s decisions, or your own past [***stories***](#story) and beliefs. Another usage may be "***at the effect of*** *some circumstance*": to be a *victim of circumstances* (or even *dependent upon some circumstance* for success). “***At Effect***” is the stance of seeing life as *happening to you* where your thoughts, feelings, and outcomes are determined by *external forces*. “**Effect**”= You are *responding* automatically to *external* triggers (or *forces*). *See also* [***At Cause***](#at-cause).<br />
<a id="breakthrough"></a>
<a id="being"></a>
• <u><b><i>Authenticity</u></b></i>.<small> (also expressed as "***Authentic***" or "***Inauthentic***").  In the **Landmark Forum’s** context, “***Authenticity***” refers to a **way of** [***being***](#being) in which you are fully aligned with [***what is so***](#whats-so)—in other words, telling the truth about your current experience (thoughts, feelings, and circumstances) without hiding, pretending, or being driven by concerns about “*looking good*” or “*being right*.”  One is being ***authentic*** when one is being *consistent* with how they portray themselves to be, with others and *themselves*. People who are ***authentic*** are *more direct*, and offer absolute candor, in their internal dialogue and also expressing themselves with others. <br />
• <u><b><i>Breakthrough</u></b></i>.<small> Freeing yourself from some limitation that allows you to achieve immediate and permanent leaps in performance and *quality of life*. When "the light bulb clicks on in your head" and you "*get it*", and it causes a discrete change in behavior.  Breakthroughs are one of the first results building towards [***Transformation***](#transformation). <br />
• <u><b><i>Cause</u></b></i>. <small> *See* [***At Cause***](#at-cause)<br />
• <u><b><i>Being </u></b></i><small> (often expressed as a "***way of being***"). In **Landmark** the phrase “***way of being***” (or simply “***being***”) describes the overall [***stance***](#stand) or *presence* a person brings to any situation. It’s not just a *single* behavior or attitude, but rather a combination of: <br />
    • **Mindset and Emotions**: The beliefs, assumptions, or emotional tone you hold. <br />
    • **Body Language and Tone**: How you carry yourself physically, speak, and gesture. <br />
    • **Underlying Commitments**: The intentions or priorities (often unspoken) that shape how you engage with others and respond to events.<br />
Rather than focusing solely on *behaviors*, **Landmark** asserts that [***how you show up***](#shows-up)—your manner of “[***being***](#being)”—underlies the *results you get*. In **The Forum**, participants discover that much of their “[***way of being***](#being)” is *automatic* and shaped by ***past experiences***. People operate as if they have ***no choice*** about how they are ***being***, [***acting***](#act), or [***showing-up***](#show-up) in certain given situations. And [***Transformation***](#transformation) *arises* when you [***distinguish***](#distinguish) (or “notice”) those *default ways* of [***being***](#being)—and realize you can ***choose new ways*** that serve your commitments or [***possibilities***](#possibilities).  Landmark activities (exercises and coaching) aim to help you *consciously* “*create*” a [***way of being***](#being)—e.g., ***being*** **bold**, ***being*** **generous**, ***being*** **unstoppable**—*instead of defaulting* to ***what’s comfortable*** or **habitual**. <br />
<a id="complete"></a>
A key aspect of shifting one’s way of being is to do so ***authentically***[#authenticity] (in alignment with your truth) and with [***integrity***](#integrity) (aligned with your word). 
<a id="cost"></a>
• ***Breakdown***. A ***breakdown*** happens when some [***possibility***](#possibility), *intention* or *commitment* is frustrated, stopped or thwarted.  When things don't go as expected or *intended*, or when you don't do as you said you would -- "not keeping your word" (also known as *a loss of* [***integrity***](#integrity)), a ***breakdown*** has occured.  In *Landmark* ***Breakdowns*** are viewed as *opportunities* to apply what you learned to re-commit, *get* [***complete***](#complete), and restore [***integrity***](#integrity). <br />
• ***Complete***. When one is ***complete*** with any aspect of the past, and therefore the past has *no constraint* on who one is *being* or how they are acting in the *present*. In communication, *being complete* is one left with no *lingering resentments*, *regrets* or "*unfinished business*".<br />
• ***Cost***. (as used in [***Rackets***](#racket)&trade;). The impact of one’s reactive ways of *being* and acting. *See also* [***Payoff***](#payoff). The *costs* of [***Rackets***](#racket)&trade; are *love/affinity*, *vitality/well-being*, *self-expression*, and *satisfaction/fulfillment*, all of which fall under [***Aliveness***](#aliveness).<br />
<a id="choose-decide"></a>
• ***Change***. (*versus* [***Transformation***](#transformation)). ***Change*** begins with a something that is ***made different*** *in distance* (from *here* to *there*), or *in time* (from *now* to *then*) or *in form* (for example, from a *square* to a *circle*). An aspect of the nature of ***change*** is that **change causes the persistence** ***of the something being changed***. ***Change*** is a *gradual*, *continual shift*. [***Transformation***](#transformation), on the other hand, is a *discrete jump*: a caterpillar ***transforms*** into a moth or butterfly, but the *metamorphosis* that happens *in the cocoon* is ***change***. Improvement and evolution are **in the world of** ***change***. ***Transformation*** is about something entirely ***new***, ***different***, a ***creation***. So **Change = a+1** , **Transformation = before was A, now is B**.<br />
<a id="context"></a>
• ***Choosing vs. Deciding***. <br />
In *language*, "***Deciding***" is a somewhat destructive word *related* to ***other*** "&ast;cide" words like "sui**cide**", "insecti**cide**", "geno**cide**", and many others. "&ast;cide" words like ***Decide*** are the result of [***applying reason***](#reason) to ***eliminate alternatives***: effectively **killing** ***other options*** or [***possibilities***](#possibility). Usually a *single thing* is left, and that becomes ***the decision***. ***Choosing***, on the other hand, is about **making a** ***choice*** purely for the sake of ***choosing***, ***not*** [***applying reason***](#reason), ***not*** applying logic, and ***not*** removing or disqualifying (**killing**) the other choices. <br />
***Choices*** dont *run out* in life, only your ***decisions*** do make you *run out of* ***choices***.  At the bottom of *every* ***decision*** is either fundamental ***choice*** ***or*** *reason*: "*I choose to believe* ..." or "*I choose to trust* ..." --adding "... *because*" makes it a [***reason***](#reason). By using [***reason***](#reason) (***decision***), you *absolve yourself* from [***responsibility***](#responsibility) *for* the ***choice***: it becomes the *fault of the* [***reason***](#reason) or the ***reasoning*** *process* if it fails. ***Choice***, though, *demands* [***responsibility***](#responsibility) for *making the* ***choice***. *See also* [***At Choice***](#at-choice).<br />
• ***Clearing***. The most common analogy is of a field, and removing the stones and stumps and whatever obstacles are there in the field, that interfere with the functioning of the field: whether to grow something, or to play a game, or something else. The abstraction in this case is a mental construct in which possibilities can be placed, created. The clearing is like a vacuum, and can draw things towards it. If the thing in the clearing is "I'm no good" then it draws things that supports that attitude. You are then a clearing for "I'm no good". If you want the possibility of contribution to the world to be in your clearing, to draw those flavors of possibilities and opportunities, then you would need to remove the "I'm no good" thing from your clearing. <br />
<a id="curriculum"></a>
• ***Context***. Context is your [***occurring***](#occur) *world*; the total of how the world around you, and *the people* and *things* in it (either in totality, or in a *given situation*), and how they ***show up*** for you. Nearly all ***context*** in which humans live is *created*. As a "[***meaning-making machine***](#meaning-machine)", it forms the setting and the background of your story and you tend to take actions based upon it in response. And you take it for granted and don't realize it: the one thing your occurring world doesn'tautomatically occur for you as is context. For example, for a fish, water is a major part of his context. A fish has no appreciation of water, it's just there, life consists of dealing with it all the time, he 'swims in it'. No other fish has ever been out of water for any length of time and come back to tell him what it's like, so the fish doesn't know anything but water, and nothing else is possible to him. (The difference is, the fish's context of water is beneficial to him, and he can't overcome it and survive. You, however, might "swim in" a context that isn't altogether beneficial to you, and that you can overcome. By contrast, responsibility is an empowering context.) When your life sucks, when you're in a negative or disempowering context; the way to break out of it, to overcome the negative or disempowering context, is to distinguish something (see Distinguish, Distinction). Then you can see your *disempowering story* as a [***story***](#story), and take new action in alignment with reality; or take on one or more new ways of being that might work better for you. <br />
• ***Curriculum for Living***.&trade; The Landmark curriculum, which includes the original 3-Day **Landmark Forum** &reg;, The **Advanced Course** &reg;, The **Self Expression and Leadership Program**, and The **Landmark Forum In Action Series**. <br />
<a id="distinction"></a>
<a id="distinguish"></a>
<a id="dominate"></a>
• ***Disappear***. To "*disappear something*" is to eliminate it, such as to *disappear a* ***Complaint***. *See also* [***Racket***](#racket). <br/>
• ***Distinction***. A *distinction* is a linguistic phenomenon that brings something *into being* as a presence, for which previously there was no presence. *Distinction* also comes from sublanguages created to facilitate an area of thought or information -- the example of physics I used above. A *distinction* is simply a ***term***, a *word* used to name something to ***facilitate the abstraction***, for the *discussion* and/or *use* of that thing. Being able to make distinctions is about the most critical aspect to getting anything out of **The Landmark Forum**.<br />
• ***Distinguish***. To take something from an undifferentiated background and bring it to the foreground. <br />
• ***Domainate/Avoid Domaination* Axis***. Human beings often unconciously find themselves either trying to ***dominate a situation*** **or avoid** ***being dominated***. This age-old natural dynamic can shape how we *communicate*, make *decisions*, and *relate to others*. **Landmark** sometimes refers to this as operating on a “***dominate or avoid domination***” axis, and it's closely tied to "[***the need to be right***](#being-right)".  **Landmark** suggests that many of our *actions* (and *reactions*) stem from a largely *unconscious* need to ensure we’re in control (***dominance***) or *not* under *someone else’s* control (***avoidance of domination***). This is seen as a primary driver in interactions, from workplace conversations to personal relationships. This dynamic is where "[***Rackets***](#racket)" come from, and the overall “***dominate / avoid domination***” pattern keeps people stuck in defensive / reactive cycles. Becoming aware of it frees up mental and emotional energy for more creative or authentic action. <br />
• ***Effect***. *See* [***At effect***](#at-effect). <br />
• ***Empty***. Not *real*, *made up*, no substance. Generally used in conjunction with "meaningless" as in "**empty and meaningless**" and used in the "***Emtpy And Meaningless***" exercise.  See "***Meaningless***" below. <br />
• ***Enrollment***. A kind of sharing that causes a new possibility to be present for *another person*, such that they are touched, moved, or inspired by that new possibility. This term has nothing to do with signing-up for *The Forum*, which is [***Registration***(#registration). <br />
<a id="freedom"></a>
<a id="get-it"></a>
• [***The Landmark Forum***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide#Landmark_Forum). **An accelerated learning experience, set up as a guided dialog between the instructor and participants designed to bring about a** [***transformational shift**](#transformation) ***in the participants***. Effectiveness and quality-of-life can become alterned, even [***Transformed***](#transformation), in three days. The first course that leads to the "[***Advanced Courses***](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/advanced-programs/the-landmark-advanced-course) (part of the [***Curriculum for Living***](#curriculum) but there are several you can choose from, now). **The Landmark Forum** &reg; ® is the *entry point* for all Landmark programs and ***Advanced Courses***. <br />
• ***Freedom***. A [***State of Being***](#being). ***Freedom*** comes from being *at ease*. ***Freedom*** comes from being *effective*. ***Experiencing Freedom*** comes from being generative (e.g. having conversations that are [***possibility-based***](#possibility)). <br />
• ***Get it*** or ***Getting it***. When you “***get it***,” you have a moment of genuine *insight* or *clarity* about a **Landmark** ***distinction***(#distinction), *exercise*, or *concept*. It’s not just *intellectual understanding*; rather, you see something or experience dialoge in a way that *changes* your perspective or shakes up your assumptions. **Example**: you might be wrestling with the notion of “[***responsibility***](#responsibility)” in *Landmark’s* sense (i.e., *distinct* from ***blame*** or ***fault***). You would have heard it explained multiple times, but at some point, the concept “***clicks***”—you actually grasp the power of [**holding yourself as** ***the source of your experience***](#at-cause). That’s when you might say to the Forum Leader or facilitator: “**I** ***got it***.” <br />
In the context of **Landmark**, “***to get it***” and “[***to pop***](#pop)” both point to different *shifts*: “***getting it***” emphasizes the *cognitive clarity* or understanding of a key [***distinction***](#distinction), while “[***popping***](#pop)” zeroes in on the emotional/experiential [***breakthrough experience***](#breakthrough)—a moment of sudden [***freedom***](#freedom) or [***new possibility***](#possibility) that often feels palpable in the room.  So *each term* highlights a *slightly different aspect* of experiencing *sudden insight* or *release*. Together, the experiencing *both* of these things are required to achieve [***Transformation***](#transformation). “***Getting it***” often precedes a *behavioral shift* or a deep internal shift. Once you truly “***get***” a **Landmark** principle, you’re more likely to *live it*, not just talk about it.  *See also* [***Pop***](#pop). <br />
• ***Graduate***. A person who has completed **The Landmark Forum**. <br />
<a id="integrity"></a>
• ***I***. What people tend to think of, in its capacity as an ***Identity***, as being a collection of characteristics, attributes, and experiences from the past. Landmark tries to (at least *temporarily*) get you to see and understand ***I***, **not** as ***a concept of self*** but instead **just simply a pattern of neurons** ***firing****.  This allows you, at least temporarily, work to view Events, Moments, and concepts of ***Identity*** differently. *See also* ***Identity*** in the following term. <br />
• ***Identity***. A [***Story***](#story) that we invented about ourselves. The process of inventing an ***Identity*** begins in childhood, as we gradually adopted [***ways of Being***](#being) and [***Acting***](#act) to deal successfully with things that didn't quite go the way we thought they should. <br />
• ***Informative Learning***. *Learning* that increases what people *know* and adds to their skills by bringing new knowledge to an *existing worldview* and **frame of reference**. Compare to [***Transformative learning***](#transformation). <br />
<a id="life"></a>
<a id="listening"></a>
• ***Integrity***. ***Integrity*** is a *state* or condition of *being whole*, [***complete***](#complete) and unimpaired, in perfect condition. For a person, ***integrity*** is a matter of a person’s word. The extent to which *who you are* reflects the person you *intend to be*.  It is presented, though, from a perspective of *workability*. The *more workable*, the *more* ***integrity***, the *less workable*, there is a *loss of* ***integrity***. *Keeping* one's word is associated with ***integrity*** -- agreeing with common usage -- *but in* **Landmark**, it is a progression. ***Not*** keeping your word means you were ***inauthentic*** about your word. [***Inauthenticity***](#authenticity) leads to unreliability, which reduces workability, and thus a loss of integrity. If you say you will be at a business meeting at 5pm and show up at 5:10pm, there is some ***inauthenticity***, and there is the loss of 10 minutes of time, reducing the *workability* of the meeting, which may have to still end on time.  So there is *less time* for discussion, information sharing, etc which can lead to [***incompleteness***](#complete), which *reduces workability*. Thus a *lack of* ***integrity***, a loss of integrity, or simply, no integrity. <br />
• ***Life***.  *As in* "*yourself and your life*." Our entire set of *relationships with people*. <br />
<a id="meaningless"></a>
<a id="meaning-machine"></a>
• ***Listening***.  In Landmark Education, "*Listening*" does include the action of actually listening to another person in the common sense, but also includes **a state of** ***being***. In this regard, the qualifying statements are similar to "... in your listening". This state of being is recognized as providing a coloration to your listening to what others are saying, and to what is happening around you, even if no sound is hitting your ears. It is the application of interpretation, and the recognition that we are always applying some sort of interpretation to our sensory input. By recognizing that we are applying color, and the color that is being applied, we can then choose that coloration. The state of being is referred to as "your clearing", and that clearing provides the coloration, the interpretation, and the responses produced. <br />
• ***Meaningless***. The *absence* of inherent meaning. Used in conjunction with "***empty***" as in "**empty and meaningless**", which comes up towards the end of the course during the "***Empty And Meaningless***" exercise. This sentiment comes from Ecclesiastes and other philosophical texts from several eras. ***Meaning*** **is the association of things with** ***other*** **things**. This is an action of interpretation, of creating "***story***" anytime we are in the act of ***making-meaning***.  Since it is *made up*, it is *not real*, and therefore *empty*. People tend to use "*meaning*" to ascribe substance and *value* to something. But since the meaning is *made up* (*empty*), it is really meaningless, *without substance*, and thus subject to *change*, *alteration*, *transformation*, or *disappearance* by you.  Being able to suspend or "*remove a meaning which does not serve you*", instead of the default of being a ***Meaning-Making machine*** (see term below) is one of the more powerful concepts taught during the 3-Day **Landmark Forum** course. <br />
<a id="occur"></a>
• ***Meaning-Making Machines***. The Landmark Forum establishes that "**humans are** ***meaning making machines***" on Day 1, which means: we assign ***meaning*** to *everything that happens to us*. ⁣***Everything***. The **problem**, **Landmark** states, is that most of the time ***meaning*** gets assigned *subconsciously*, and often we assign things a ***negative meaning***. ⁣⁣That’s just the *nature of the human mind*: we go negative (our minds are these "[if it bleeds, it *leads*"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/if_it_bleeds,_it_leads) things, when it comes to [***Interpreting***](#story)). ⁣And because we often do this *subconciously*, we *do not* ***see*** that we're *creating-meaning* and feeding an overall [***Interpretation***](#what-happened) or [***Story***](#story)", of an external event or moment. And, again, because we do *all* of this *subconciously* and automatically our "[***stories***](#story)" are often taken as ***fact*** --- *not* the [***Interpretations***](#what-happened) that they *actually are* in [***reality***](#reality).  [***Getting this concept***](#get-it) early is an important core foundation for understanding concepts later on like [***Rackets***](#racket) and how they can rob us of [***Aliveness***](#aliveness). *See also* [***Story***](#story) and [***What Happened***](#what-happened) terms.<br />
<a id="ontology"></a>
<a id="payoff"></a>
<a id="pop"></a>
• ***Occur*** (often used in the *plural* form, as in "***how it occurs*** ...").  An active form "occurring" and in the past tense "how it occurred ..." both allude to the [***interpretation***](#story) of something. Occurring applies [***story***](#story) and [***reason***](#reason) to *create your view* of [***what happened***](#what-happened), or to ***how you think*** about something (often *independent* of facts or [***what's so***](#whats-so)). ***Occuring*** is **Landmark** shorthand for “*the way I see, perceive, or interpret this situation*.”, and ***occurring*** is a subconscious summarization *and* associative process that hits the conscious mind as [***real***](#reality) or as ***truth*** (again, often *independent* of facts or [***what's so***](#whats-so)). <br />
It is difficult to recognize this without training, or just by reading this in a book, or *this Glossary*. **Example**: someone yelling at you could ***occur*** as them being *angry* from far away (if you don't hear everything they're saying, and only looking at their face); or you first are thinking that ***they think*** you are *deaf* or "*stupid*"; when in actual (objective) [***reality***](#reality) the person may have just been trying to urgently get your attention to an oncoming car, or other danger or emergency. To stop and briefly note to yourself "*how something is* ***occuring***" can help you suspend our "[***meaning-making***](#meaning-machine)" nature so that we might avoid creating an unhelpful [***story***](#story) about [***what happened***](#what-happened) inaccurately.<br />
Learning to *see* how things ***occur*** *for you* is a big *first-step* towards trying to describe [***what happened***](#what-happened), which you'd otherwise automatically be beholden to your ***interpretations*** unknowingly-and not able to evaluate ***how something occurred*** for you. When you are noticing how something “***occurs***” to you—and reframing that view—you can open new avenues for action or collaboration. <br />
Landmark underscores that what “***occurs***” (internally) and what “***shows up***” (externally) are both [***distinctions***](#distinction) you can notice, and choose to alter. <br />
• ***Ontology*** (and/or ***Ontological***).  A set of *concepts* and *categories* in a subject area or *domain* that shows their properties and the *relations between them*. Ontology deals with the **nature of** [***Being***](#being). Landmark's emphasis on *language* and it's ***Ontology*** is predicated upon the notion that humans ***think in language***, and that mastering one's *internal language* is one key to living powerfully. <br />
***Ontology*** in the *philosophical sense* is a theoretical discipline, considered by some Philosphers to be (roughly) a possible science of [***what is***](#what-is), of the kinds and structures of objects, properties, events, processes and relations in every area of [***reality***](#reality).<br />
<a id="possibility"></a>
• ***Payoff***. A ***payoff*** is something one *gets* out of certain ways of [***Being***](#being) and [***acting***](#act) that is not immediately obvious. [***Rackets***](#racket), for example, are all about ***payoffs***; however, [***Rackets***](#racket) also exact many hidden [***Costs****](#cost).<br />
The ***payoff*** can be *a*ddictive*, because it reaffirms your self-image and [***your story***](#story) about the situation. ***Payoffs*** usually satisfy an immediate emotional or ego need (to *win*, to be *validated*), but they don’t necessarily foster real connection or growth-and they often come at [***a Cost***](#cost). <br />
**Landmark’s** goal is to help participants see these dynamics (and the ***payoffs***/[***costs***](#cost) they yield) so they can choose new ways of interacting—ways that aren’t *locked into* [***being right***](#being-right*) or [***avoiding being wrong***](#dominate). By breaking free of the [***dominate/avoid domination***](#dominate) cycle and acknowledging that [***the need to be right***](#being-right) is *just one expression* of that, you open space for [***authentic***](#authenticity) communication, mutual respect, and real collaboration.<br />
• ***Pop***. There are no statistics on this, but it's generally understood that everyone who completes The **Landmark Forum** gets [***transformation***](#transformation) on at least some matters. The *experience of it* is distinct from one person to the next. Some people experience a *more powerful transformation* in the [***Advanced Courses***](#advanced) than from the original **Landmark Forum**. But **Landmark** says the bottom-line is that if you participate in the program, and take what you get, you will ***Pop*** -- meaning: you'll "[***get***](#get-it)" a **Landmark** principle or concept, such that you will ***pop*** and experience [*transformation*](#transformation). <br />
A “***pop***” can be catalytic. Once you’ve had that emotional or embodied [***breakthrough***](#breakthrough), your communication, relationships, or sense of [***what’s possible***](#possibility) tend to change markedly—and often *quite quickly*.
When attendees ***pop*** or otherwise "[***get***](#get-it)", it manifests via *physical* and *emotional* indicators: People sometimes describe a wave of relief, laughter, or even tears when they “***pop***.” <br />
An anology often used by the **Forum Leader** is: "*when making popcorn, the kernels cooking will all* "***pop*** *at different times.  So if you stay with it, and honestly take what you get, you** ***will pop*** *at some point during the course*." <br /> 
There is some overlap between when you "***get it***" and when you "***pop***". *When you* “***get it***” you usually have made a big [***distinction***(#distinction)] that leads to a new *inside* (setting the stage for a [***breakthrough***](#breakthrough)), and *when you* “[***pop***](#pop)” your [***breakthrough***](#breakthrough) leads you to experience a *release* and sudden shift which can lead quickly to [***transformation***](#transformation). Graduates and participants often use “***get it***” and “***pop***” in conversation to describe specific turning points during the Forum or other Landmark courses. The language helps them *name* those [***breakthrough***](#breakthrough) moments. <br />
<a id="racket"></a>
<a id="reality"></a>
• ***Possibility***. A phenomenon in language that creates a new future *right now*. *Possibility* leaves us with ***Power*** and [***Freedom***](#freedom). <br />
• ***Power***. The rate at which an *intention* is turned into a *result*. Power comes from ***possibility*** and from being [***authentic***](#authenticity). <br />
• ***Racket***.&trade; A ***Racket*** is a *persistent* ***complaint*** combined with a *fixed* way of [***Being***](#being). ***Rackets*** are maintained because of [***Payoffs***](#payoff), and they persist until *dropping the* ***Racket*** (and thus its associated [***cost***](#cost)) is chosen. This complaint pattern can give you an ongoing sense of righteousness or victimhood—both of which feed [***the need to be right***](#being-right).  <br />
By *giving up* the ***need to be right***, you a can own *and drop* [***your Rackets***](#racket) and live [***Authentically***](#authenticity) and foster relationships built on honesty and mutual respect, rather than hidden agendas. **Landmark** says that ***Rackets*** (and their [***costs***](#cost))rob us of [***Aliveness***](#aliveness). *See also* [***Payoff***](#payoff) and [***Cost****](#cost) terms. <br />
<a id="reason"></a>
<a id="registration"></a>
• ***Reality***. That which is ***real*** either ***independently of language*** (e.g., "***a car***"), and that which is ***real*** *only* ***in*** *language* (e.g., ***a concept***).  A proper understanding of how ***reality exists as a concept*** is *critical* to understanding the concepts covered in the ["***What Happened***"](#what-happened) terminology and exercises. <br />
• ***Reason***. An excuse we invent to justify *choices* we make. That would be Ambrose Bierce's definition. When choices are made according to "reasons," they are distinguished as the "machine" operating, based on assumptions about truth and reality. Genuine choice operates on another level. Reasoning is not denied, but distinguished as rooted in our [***stories***](#story) about reality. NOTE: This is not a Landmark term. Just the generic meaning of the word is used in Landmark programs. *See also* [***Choosing vs Deciding***](#choose-decide) and ***Reasonable***. <br />
<a id="responsibility"></a>
• ***Reasonable***. To justify *acting*, or ***not*** *acting*, based on [***reasons***](#reason) and ***justifications***.  *See also* [***Choosing vs. Deciding***](#choose-decide). The ability to *choose* when you want to be ***reaonable*** *or* ***unreasonable*** is one of the main key life-altering [*breakthroughs*](#breakthrough) that The Landmark Forum wants to impart to its Graduates. <br />
• ***Registration***. *See also* ***Enrollment***. Some action that registers a commitment to the future, for example registering for a gym membership.  <br />
<a id="shows-up"></a>
• ***Resentment***. A poison people swallow hoping it will kill the other person. NOTE: This is not a Landmark term. Just the generic meaning of the word is used in Landmark programs. [***Rackets***](#racket) are  <br />
• ***Responsibility***. This is a key area of the **Landmark Forum** that people can struggle with, and is one of the most difficult to explain to anyone who *hasn't attended* **The Forum**, so I will let founder [**Werner Erhard**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Erhard) explain it: <br />
> “**Responsibility** begins with the **willingness to** ***take the [stand***](#stand) **that one is** [***cause in the matter of one’s life***](#at-cause). It is a ***declaration*** ***not*** an *assertion*, that is, it (*Responsibility*)is a **[context](#context) from which one chooses to** ***live***. **Responsibility** is ***not*** *burden*, *fault*, *praise*, *blame*, *credit*, *shame* or *guilt*. In ***Responsibility*** in **Landmark**, **there is no evaluation of** ***good*** **or** ***bad***, ***right*** **or** ***wrong***. **There is simply** [***what’s so***](#whats-so), **and** ***the [stand](#stand) you choose to take*** **on** [***what’s so***](#whats-so). **Being responsible** starts with the willingness to deal with a situation ***from the view*** of life that *you* are the [*generator** of what *you* ***do***](#at-cause), what *you* ***have***. and what *you* ***are***. That is **not** "***the truth***". It is a *place to* [***stand***](#stand). No one can ***make you responsible***, nor can you ***impose responsibility*** *on another*. It is a grace you *give* ***yourself*** – an ***empowering [context](#context)*** that leaves you with a *say in the matter of life*.” <br />

-[***Werner Erhard***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Erhard)  <br /><br />
• [***Self-Expression and Leadership Program***](https://www.landmarkworldwide.com/advanced-programs/self-expression-and-leadership-program). The final courses in the original [***Curriculum for Living***](#curriculum) &reg;.  This program expands one’s natural capacity for providing leadership and making a difference as a natural ***self-expression***. <br />
<a id="strongsuit"></a>
<a id="stand"></a>
• ***Show up*** (as in "how you ***show-up***, or "how something ***shows-up*** for you"). “How I ***show up***” or “how something ***shows up***” generally refers to how someone or something appears or presents itself in a given situation. This could include your body language, your choice of words, your energy, or how you [***act***](#act) toward others (e.g. ***showing up*** [***authentically***](#authenticity), or ***showing up*** having [***integrity***](#integrity)).  **Example**: “You consistently ***show-up*** as annoyed, which impacts how everyone interacts with you.” The emphasis is on awareness of *impact*. **Another Example**: if you’re ***showing up*** distracted or closed-off, that may affect how people interact with you. <br />
Becoming conscious of *how* you ***show up*** is a step toward [***being***](#being) at choice in how you present yourself—so you can align your way of being with your commitments or intentions. **Last Example***: if you're going with your default *interpretation* of something, how it ***shows-up*** for you (your *experience* of a situation) may be negative leaving you ***At-Effect***(#at-effect) of a *disempowering* [***story***](#story).<br />
Landmark underscores that what “***shows up***” (externally) and what “[***occurs***](#occur)” (internally) are both [***distinctions***](#distinction) you can notice, and choose to alter. By consciously *choosing* how you “***show up***,” you can positively influence relationships, teams, and outcomes.<br />
<a id="story"></a>
• ***Speaking into the listening***. Effectively communicating to another *such that* the **communication is** ***heard*** in the way in which the speaker ***intended***. <br />
• ***Stand*** (as in "*taking a* ***stand***", or "***standing*** *in your commitments*").  “***Stand***” refers to a **powerful declaration** or *commitment* you make—**both** *to yourself* and *to others*—that shapes how you [***show up***](#show-up) and ***take action*** in the world.  Unlike a mere *opinion* or *belief*, a “***stand***” is something you *choose* to [***be***](#being)...rather than something you simply *have*. It serves as a guiding principle or commitment that informs your choices and interactions, creating a powerful [***context***](#context) for [***transformation***](#transformation) and [***possibility***](#possibility).<br />
The **Landmark Forum** emphasizes that **language isn’t merely** *descriptive*—it can be ***generative***. By ***taking a stand***, you use language to generate a new [***possibility***](#possibility) or [***reality***](#reality), *not* just *talk* about it. That’s why “*I* ***stand*** *for X*” has a **different impact** than “*I’d like X to happen*.”  A ***stand*** also tests your [***integrity***](#integrity) and [***authenticity***](#authenticity)—if you *say* ***you stand for something***, your actions, words, and presence should align with it. Whenever you break from that commitment (*see* [***Breakdown***](#breakdown)), you can notice the gap and restore integrity by recommitting to your stand. <br />
A ***stand*** should ***not*** ever be confused with a **goal** or **wish**: a *goal* might have a deadline or a specific **outcome**. A ***stand*** is *broader* and *more* ***fundamental***; it affects how you relate to everything, including unexpected circumstances or failures, because it’s an expression of who you are [***being***](#being), not just what you want to accomplish.  Also ***taking a stand*** might ***feel arbitrary*** *at first* (because you can [***choose***](#choose-decide) any ***stand*** you want), but ***once declared***, it becomes a **guiding principle** you ***own and live by***. It’s less about being “***right***” and more about ***being true*** to what you’ve publicly *committed to*. <br />
In **Landmark** (and **est** before it), ***taking a “stand”*** means *creating* and *inhabiting* a powerful [***context***](#context) or commitment that informs every aspect of your behavior.  It’s an active, generative way of [***shaping your actions***](#at-cause), *language*, and *relationships*, rather than [***passively being shaped by circumstances***](#at-effect) or beliefs. <br />
• ***Stinginess***. Deliberately holding oneself, and one’s contribution, "*close to the vest*" and without generosity.  Also not being [***authentic***](#authenticity) or having [***integrity***](#integrity) are two ways in which we might [***be***](#being) or [***show-up***](#show-up) for others as ***stingy*** or *not generous*. <br />
• ***Stoicism***. Not *directly* related to The **Landmark Forum** curriculum or a term from the 3-day course; *however*, ***Stoicism*** as a philosophy informs the concepts of "[***At Cause***](#at-cause)" and "[***At Effect***](#at-effect)". <br />
• ***Story***. A "***story***" is an account or *interpretation* of past events often mistakenly taken for [**what actually** ***happened***](#what-happened).  “*She told a story*” does not mean “*she lied*.” Rather, any account (in our internal dialogue, or when talking to another person) is subconciously ***an interpretation***.  Yet we tend to believe our interpretations are facts. If another **Landmark Forum** Leader or Graduate asks you "is that really [***what happened***](#what-happened), or is this [***your story***](#story)?", they aren't calling you out or saying you were being untruthful: they are inviting you to stop and examine if you are unconciously confusing your *interpretation* with [***what's so***](#whats-so) or **what actually** ***happened***](#what-happened). <br />
<a id="being-right"></a>
• ***Strong suit***. A way of ***being*** and ***acting*** that one relies on to produce results and make it in [***life***](#life). <br />
<a id="transformation"></a>
• ***Superstition***. The system of ideas, beliefs, social and cultural assumptions, and *taken-for-granted* conclusions (etc) through which an individual interprets and interacts with the world, other people, and himself or herself.  Living with others' *Dogma* and adhering to it, instead of living so to speak. NOTE: This is not a Landmark term. Just the generic meaning of the word is used in Landmark programs. <br />
• ***The Need to be Right***. For ***the need to be right***, possible [***payoffs***](#payoff) include: *feeling superior*, *maintaining the illusion of control*, *voiding vulnerability or scrutiny*, or *getting sympathy or attention*.
• ***Transformation***. The invention of a new realm of ***possibility*** for yourself and your life. The invention of the realm is a necessary condition, but not sufficient for transformation. Without resultant new actions in alignment with the possibilities populating the realm, the invention is just a mental exercise.<br />
• ***Transformative learning***. Transformative learning, gives people an awareness of the basic structures in which one knows, thinks, and acts in the world. From that awareness comes a fundamental shift that leaves people more fully in accord with their own possibilities and those of others. Transformative learning is contrasted with Informational Learning. Informational learning increases knowledge and ability. Transformative learning results in new perspectives and new abilities (and sometimes disabilities). The common example is of learning to ride a bicycle. Very little information is provided, like "pedal". Suddenly the learner gets balance and is able to ride the bike without help. They have discovered it for themselves, and may never loose the ability to ride a bike. The experience, the learning, transforms the person, their perspective and their abilities. Before they couldn't, now they can. And, a whole new world or realm of possibilities is opened up. <br />
• ***Unreasonable***. *Not* to be mistaken for *irrational*. To *be unreasonable* is to *go beyond* one’s *reasons*, *justifications* or lengthy *considerations* to *act* on something one is committed to. *See also* [***Choosing vs. Deciding***](#choose-decide) <br />
• ***Unreasonable Request***. A request that requires one to go *beyond* one’s reasons, justifications and considerations to act on something one is committed to.<br />
<a id="what-happened"></a>
• ***Vicious circle***.&trade; The human tendency to collapse [***what happened***](#what-happened) with **the** ***story we tell*** **ourselves (or others)** ***ABOUT what happened***. **The story** creates a clearing, a ***listening***, for *that which supports the story* (confirmation bias, etc), resulting in *more occurrences* of *things that further support* ***the story***, forming a self-supporting ***Vicious Circle***.<br />
<a id="whats-so"></a>
• ***What Happened***. ***Consensual*** (agreed-on) shared [***reality***](#reality), or "*objective*" [***reality***](#reality) *aside from* (not relating at all to) judgment, blame, right/wrong, good/bad, and *other forms of* "[***meaning***](#meaning-machine)." ***What happens*** [***occurs***](#occur) to us ***as it is analyzed*** our [***Already Always Listening***](#aal) to be good/bad, etc. If my ex-wife told me she had a problem with what I've done, that's ***what happened***. If I say in response that "*she was unreasonable and mean to me*", that's [***my story***](#story]) about it, **not** necessarily ***what happened***. *See also* [***Story***](#story) which is a core component of understanding this term and concept. --**NOTE**: In our current era where ["*Alternative Facts*"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts) inflames or distorts discussions requiring an *agreed-upon* [***reality***](#reality), successfully *working through* ***What Happened*** or ***What's so*** (for **The Forum's** purposes) is truly a challenge!<br />
• ****What is*** and/or ***What's so****.  In **Landmark** there’s a *difference* between the *raw facts* of a situation and the [***interpretations***](#meaning-machine) or [***stories***](#story) we layer on top of those facts (*See* ***What Happened*** above).  **Landmark** uses "***What's so***" to direct attention to ***reality***(#reality) as it ***is***: *independent* of our habitual biases, judgments, or narratives.  <br />
**Landmark** emphasizes that: **while** “***what is so***” **is factual**, our ***experience*** often depends on the [***meaning***](#meaning-machine) or [***story***](#story) *we create*. By recognizing the difference, you can see where your emotions come from ([***the story***](#story)) look only at *the facts themselves*. **Landmark** suggests that if you can [***distinguish***](#distinction) the **fact** from the [***interpretation***](#story), you have the [***freedom***](#freedom) to choose a new way of responding. **Landmark Forum Leaders** conduct group exercises where facilitators ask participants to state **only** ***what’s so*** about something, *before* discussing feelings or interpretations. This exercise reveals how *quickly* we add [***personal meaning***](#story) or “*take things* ***personally***”, allowing the participants to have a [***breakthrough***](#breakthrough). <br />

## FAQ

#### 1. This is a *LOT* of information! How could I (and how do *you*) ever keep it all straight?  How can I ever be sure I *understand* Landmark's terminology, let alone *apply* any of it, after studying resources like this? 

**A:** <br />

**The *short* answer is**: ***you probably can't***.  This Glossary and my [Landmark posts](https://julianwest.me/Blog/a-funny-thing-happened-after-the-forum-part-1/) are not.  In any discipline teaching philosophical or conceptual terms, "*knowledge through direct experience*" is primarily how you *learn* them. **Landmark's** teaching is [***Ontological***](#ontology)), the idea that our ***understanding of the nature of a thing*** ("([***being***](#Being)" etc) is primarily formed through our immediate ***firsthand interactions*** with it, rather than relying solely on abstract concepts or external descriptions -- *like this Glossary*! In other words: ***experiencing something directly*** allows for a *more profound* and intuitive *grasp* of its essence. <br />

**To put succintly**: the phrase "[**If you know, you** ***know***...](https://www.planoly.com/glossary/iykyk)" (IYKYK) applies here.  The *knowing* (*understanding* and retention) of these terms and concepts typically requires *attending* The **Landmark Forum** (or perhaps pursuing a degree focused on *both* Eastern and Western Philosophies...but The **Landmark Forum** is *cheaper* and takes less time).  I believe any layman reading this stuff *without* having attended **The Forum** is *folly* and only invites frustration.

#### 2. I have read many of these terms and concepts in other materials, or experienced them in other seminar-based courses I took in the past. Can you share what *Philosophies* inform the Landmark Forum curriculum?

**A:** <br />

Below is a list I compiled, of some of the primary philosophies (or philosophers) that I have *personally-read* (or read works *of*) which informed [Werner Erhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Erhard) in his creation of the original [**est**]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training() and the newer [**Landmark**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide) curriculums. I will include specific **Landmark** terms (in ***parenthesis***) next to each philosopher or philosophy that I cite: <br />

Alan Watts ()
Edmund Husserl and *phenomenology* (the rigorous study of concious *experience as it appears*) influenced 20th-century existential thought ([***Occur***](#occur)), Epictetus (Stoicism)
[**Marcus Aurelius**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius) ([***At Cause***](#at-cause) and [***At Effect***](#at-effect) come from Stoicism), [**Martin Heidegger**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger) and also [**The Kyoto School of Zen Philosphers**](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kyoto-school/) ([***Being***](#being)), Seneca (his letters are studied in Stoicism as they encouraged *self-master*, *choice*, and *detachment from circumstances* as paths to equanimity), Taoism (Taoist notion that events are empty until we give them meaning resonates with Taoist themes of ***wu wei*** (non-forcing) and the idea of “allowing” or “not resisting” [***what is***](#whats-so)), [**Zen**](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/japanese-zen/) ([***Being***](#Being), [***Ontology***](#ontology))
