This contents in this post, below, is <a href="https://julianwest.me/Resume/Working%20for%20Julian.pdf">sourced from a pdf doc</a> I have always kept linked within my online [CV-Resume](https://julianwest.me/Resume/).  It exists as a guide to understand how I think, and manage teams in PM or Manager roles. ü§ì <br />

# Leadership Principles <br />

- Serving Others. I lead by pu-ng the welfare of the team first. I have a service-oriented
mindset to ensure the well-being (and, thus, eÔ¨Äec?veness) of my reports, which leads to higher
morale and beAer performance. EÔ¨Äec?ve leaders make sure the work is done, yet they also
priori?ze empathy, understanding the needs, challenges, and perspec?ves of their team
members. This allows leaders to build stronger rela?onships and inspire loyalty. <br />

- Coach mode. While I put a big value on being a Servant Leader, some?mes managed
reports need a diÔ¨Äerent approach at crunch-?me. I help reports create a plan of aAack on a
problem or task, to meet the challenge. This also means demonstra?ng values such as integrity,
resilience, and hard work, which sets a standard for others to follow. I call this method ‚Äúcoach
mode‚Äù because I am leading on the field (working tasks) and resolving performance issues that I
see as-they-happen. Team leaders who can pivot to ‚Äúcoach mode‚Äù foster a culture where people
feel secure, valued, and mo?vated, leading to a more cohesive high-performing team. <br />

- Collabora?on over compe??on. I want a collabora?ve environment, rather than one
driven by internal compe??on, as it helps strengthen bonds among team members. A unified
team is more resilient and eÔ¨Äec?ve in facing external challenges. I also tend to respond to any
discovered oÔ¨Éce poli?cs situa?ons like an immune system, <br />

- The WHY is key (Vision and Purpose). People are oPen more inspired by the reasons
behind ac?ons than by the ac?ons themselves. Leaders who communicate a clear Why build
deeper connec?ons, trust, and loyalty among employees and clients or customers. Leaders who
priori?ze the Why are more likely to mo?vate and create a following that‚Äôs driven by shared
purpose and values. Leaders need to inspire this sense of purpose to align the team‚Äôs eÔ¨Äorts
toward a common goal. <br />

# Management Style Preferences <br />

- Empowering Independence. Over two decades in IT informs my management
philosophy to emphasize self-reliance, ini?a?ve, and con?nuous learning from my reports. I
teach my reports that taking initative when startng a new task, and not needing a lot of
immediate task guidance, increases their value on the team. Try to solve as much of a problem
independently as you can, before reaching out for help. Remember ge-ng ‚Äústuck‚Äù is good, so
long as you worked the problem first, a necessary step toward self-reliance. Asking ques?ons
before you work a problem robs you of growth and experience. When you come to me for help,
know that I will always ask what you‚Äôve tried up to that point. If you get stuck early and oPen
on tasks, know that means we‚Äôll be having a one-on-one to discuss your blind spots and skill
gaps to determine where you are struggling

Setting Clear Expecta?ons and Providing Support. We‚Äôre all adults and professionals
here, so I trust you to own your project tasks and escala?ons. I will set clear expecta?ons and
provide you all necessary tools and support for you to succeed. And I expect task work to get
underway without requiring deep assistance at the start of task work. If you require a lot of
guidance to even start work on tasks, a one-on-one mee?ng may occur to assess your skill blind
spots. I want a team culture where we all are eager to help each other, but we also trust each
other to work part of our assigned tasks independently un?l stuck. <br />

- System Documenta?on should provide the WHERE and WHAT, not the HOW. Good
system documenta?on always provides the WHERE and WHAT‚Äî server informa?on, IP
addresses, and other essen?al informa?on; however, it is ineÔ¨Äec?ve and poor strategy for
documenta?on to spend pages on the WHY or the HOW. Skilled and experienced staÔ¨Ä should
need the WHERE in order to begin work on solving a problem. Anything going into the HOW is
process documenta(on, which is a diÔ¨Äerent thing. Confusing system and process
documenta?on leads to confusion and ineÔ¨Äec?ve cross-training. <br />

- Process Documenta?on should be concise and extremely brief. Process documenta?on
should only come a/er good system documenta?on, and is never a replacement for skilled and
experienced. Process documenta?on should not contain endless verbiage or paragraph-sized
steps for any process. If a team is busy wri?ng process documenta?on that contains myriad
steps explaining a lot of HOW informa?on, it usually means a team has under-skilled members
or incorrectly assigned IT roles. Unless your department or group has a full-?me trainer or
documenta?on role on the team, process docs should be very concise and brief.
