# Leadership Principles <br />

- **Serving Others**. I lead by pu-ng the welfare of the team first. I have a service-oriented
mindset to ensure the well-being (and, thus, eÔ¨Äec?veness) of my reports, which leads to higher
morale and beAer performance. EÔ¨Äec?ve leaders make sure the work is done, yet they also
priori?ze empathy, understanding the needs, challenges, and perspectives of their team
members. This allows leaders to build stronger rela?onships and inspire loyalty. <br />

- **Coach mode**. While I put a big value on being a Servant Leader, some?mes managed
reports need a diÔ¨Äerent approach at crunch-?me. I help reports create a plan of aAack on a
problem or task, to meet a challenge. This also means demonstratng values such as integrity,
resilience, and hard work, which sets a standard for others. I call this ‚Äúcoach
mode‚Äù because I am leading on the field (working tasks) with the team, and resolving performance issues that I see as-they-happen. Team leaders who can pivot to ‚Äúcoach mode‚Äù foster a culture where people feel secure, valued, and mo?vated, leading to a more cohesive high-performing team. <br />

- **Collaboration over competion**. I want a collaborative environment, rather than one
driven by internal competion, as it helps strengthen bonds among team members. A unified
team is more resilient and eÔ¨Äective in facing external challenges. I also tend to respond to any
discovered oÔ¨Éce politics situations like an immune system, <br />

- **The WHY is key (Vision and Purpose)**. People are oPen more inspired by the reasons
behind actions than by the ac?ons themselves. Leaders who communicate a clear *Why* build
deeper connections, trust, and loyalty among employees and clients or customers. Leaders who
prioritize the *Why* are more likely to motivate and create a following that‚Äôs driven by shared
purpose and values. Leaders need to inspire a sense of purpose to align the team‚Äôs eÔ¨Äorts
toward a common goal. <br />

# Management Style Preferences <br />

- [**Empowering Independence**](https://julianwest.me/Blog/empowering-independence-it/). Over two decades in IT informs my management
philosophy to emphasize self-reliance, initiative, and continuous learning from my reports. I
teach my reports that ***taking initative*** when startng a new task, and not needing a lot of
immediate task guidance, increases their value on the team. Try to solve as much of a problem
independently as you can, before reaching out for help. Remember getting ‚Äústuck‚Äù is *good*, so
long as you worked the problem first, a necessary step toward self-reliance. Asking questons
before you work a problem robs you of growth and experience. When you come to me for help,
know that [I will always ask what you‚Äôve tried](https://julianwest.me/Blog/empowering-independence-it/) *up to that point*. If you stop early and often on tasks, without doing the work to *get stuck first*, know that means we‚Äôll be having a one-on-one to discuss your blind spots and skill gaps to determine where you are struggling!

- **Setting Clear Expecta?ons and Providing Support**. We‚Äôre all adults and professionals
here, so I trust you to own your project tasks and escalations. I will set clear expectations and provide you all necessary tools and support for you to succeed. I do expect task work to get underway without requiring deep assistance at the *start* of task work, but I am here to help when you are stuck. If you require a lot of guidance to begin work on tasks, a one-on-one mee?ng may occur to assess your skill blind spots. I want a team culture where we all are eager to help each other, but we also trust each other to work our assigned tasks until stuck. And if training needs are found, I want to get you whatever you need to succeed.<br />

- **System Documentation should provide the WHERE and the WHAT,** <i><u><b>not</u></i> the HOW</b>. **Good system documentation always provides the ***WHERE*** and** ***WHAT***‚Äî server information, IP
addresses, and other essential information; <i><u><however</u></i></b>, it is ineÔ¨Äective and poor strategy for documentation to spend pages on the WHY or the HOW. It can be a time sink, reflecting skill gaps. Skilled and experienced team members usually only need the WHERE, in order to begin work on something. Anything needed for the ***HOW*** must be brief ***process documentation*** and, while helpful for new team members, should only ever be concise and *outcome oriented*. Documentation is almost always be about Systems, Infra, and assets: what the team needs for ongoing Ops and Project deliverables (the HOW and WHAT). Good Documentation already is a time-consuming activity, so confusing process for systems documentation only leads to excess documentation iteration cycles and, ultimately, [**ineffective cross-training**](https://julianwest.me/Blog/empowering-independence-it/). 

 <br />

- **Process Documentation should be concise and extremely brief**. Process documentation
should only come *after* system documentation, and is never a replacement for developing skills and
experience within the team. Process documenta?on should not contain endless verbiage or paragraph-sized
steps for any process. If a team is busy writing process documentation that contains myriad
steps explaining a lot of *HOW* information, it usually reflects a lot of skill-gap among team members, or incorrectly assigned IT roles. Unless your team or department has a full-time trainer or documentation role in the group, process docs should be very concise and brief.
