This contents in this post, below, is <a href="https://julianwest.me/Resume/Working%20with%20Julian.pdf">sourced from a pdf doc</a> I have always kept linked within my online [CV-Resume](https://julianwest.me/Resume/).  It exists as a mini-manual to my brain, for any interested teams that I am working with. ðŸ¤“

# Leadership Principles <br />
- **Challenge internally, champion externally**. I find it's most helpful when our team is free
to be our biggest cri:cs by challenging the status quo, asking "Why?" 5 times, so that our
stakeholders don't have to. Once we make a decision, we move forward together. <br />

- **Listening before acting**. I tend to listen before I share my opinions to ensure I
understand others' PoV. In doing so, I hope to remove frictons with debates & incorporate
as much feedback into our team's work as possible. In discretionary moments I will provide my
honest opinions; however, know that I speak authentically, and I practice *absolute candor*
whenever direct and clear communication with colleagues and team leads is critical. <br />

- **I hope to be predictable**. I'm a firm believer in being consistent in principles. In doing so,
I hope our team & stakeholders would be less confused & can easily predict expectations. <br />

- **Directed Independence**. My ideal working style is we work together to define project
deliverables/timemelines & let the team run with it. I love to get involved to remove roadblocks,
problem solve or whiteboard new ideas. I also understand some team members want to iterate
independently during sprints or task work, and I can adjust to the flow as project work unfolds.  <br />

# Working Style Preferences

- **Emails vs. Slack**: For action items eg reading & reviewing, email is the most eï¬€ec:ve way
to reach me. For questions or discussions, Slack is my preferred platform however, I am flexible! <br />

- **I prioritize constructive feedback**. I work best when my feedback sessions (e.g. projects,
OKRs) are structured 40% on areas I did well & 60% on areas where I could have done better
with tangible examples. <br />

- **I appreciate direct communication rather than indirect communication**. I tend to
misunderstand indirect communication. Therefore, convos over video or IRL work best for me. <br />

- **More communication > less communication**. I like to send & receive updates on my
projects for feedback. Soft responses like "will read later" or "sounds good" let me know that
emails & projects have value. If they don't have value, then feedback is welcome. <br />

- **I love asking questions**. Oftentimes, I may ask involved or leading questions. I do this to understand
the thought process & logic of decisions / projects / concepts. <br />

- **Logic + data speak volumes to me**. Naturally, I am very skeptical. I need to understand
the data and/or thought process for me to get sense of concepts & pursue targeted outcomes. <br />

- **I work best with 'melines & project plans**. I record projects on a personal gan[ chart
because it's important for me to see the light at the end of the tunnel for each project. <br />

- **Complex concepts require 'me for me to process**. Certain concepts need time for me to
completely process. Sometimes, I won't fully understand in one meeting / conversation. If that's
the case, then I may come back to you later with a succinct question or two. <br />

- **I am a visual learner**. The best way to explain a concept to me is to visualize it. I love
visualizing things because it allows me to easily understand how things are connected. <br />

- **I'm a goofball**. We spend too much time at work not to enjoy it. I love cracking
jokes, sharing memes & talking about personal interests. <br />
