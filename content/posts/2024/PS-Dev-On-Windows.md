So I have seen some co-workers of late using the Windows built-in (and officially EOL / retired, but still bundled) <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/ise/introducing-the-windows-powershell-ise?view=powershell-7.4">PowerShell ISE</a> tool to write their scripts.<br />  

In a word: YUCK!


If you're a nascent PowerShell scripter, you need the best editing setup in place.  One that "gets out of the way" but also offers features for rapid devevlopment.  Enter ~~vim~~, ahem, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>. VS Code is one of the best editors for PowerShell development.  I use it every day, and as a beginner you should start with this fundamental editor for your PS script development.<br />

In this tutorial I'll walk you through setting up VS Code on Windows for PS coding/development.  And then we can explore some features VS Code offers for PowerShell, which make it such a great core scriping IDE. <br />




I didn't get into the next logical progression, where PowerShell development may take you: Git, or GitHub Repos, and creating modules (to name a few things).  But if there is any interest, I am happy to do some follow-ups to this tutoral.  I am already drafting follow-up for this post to set up VS Code ***MacOS*** for PS development. A MacBook Pro & Mac Studio are where I do 85% of my PS development these days, so I might as well give equal time there.  Maybe also a Neovim tutorial in the future.  I use it for some PS dev, though mostly I just it for python and javascript stuff.  One cool thing about vim editors and VS Code: <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim">you can make VSCode offer vim nav</a> as well. <br />

Happy scripting!
