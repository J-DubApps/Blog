PSA: blog is moving soon from <a href="blog.julianwest.me">blog.julianwest.me</a> to <a href="https://julianwest.me/Blog">julianwest.me/Blog</a>.  You can actually bookmark or switch RSS feeds now.  Soon "blog.julianwest.me" will be no more as the new one takes over.<br />

The blog is also retiring the "***Faults and Observations***" (**FAO**) name. It's just "julianwest.me" now. Simplification is the reason.  <br /> 

The blog was hosted on <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> for nearly a decade, and I'll have a separate write-up tomorrow on what lead to the move. It's mainly like I said, simplification.  But also Medium kinda sucks now, too.  And I need to dumb this thing down: remove friction to ease-of-posting. <br />

Anyway I'm liking the new setup, if you read this blog you probably will too.  I have themed it with an available Dark Mode, and unified my julianwest.me site contents & Contact info here.  Clean.  Simple. For more on the blog hosting setup, click the <b>Colophon</b> link below at the footer.<br />

So welcome to the new digs, and I now offer you a quote from <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/hello-world/">my very first post on Medium</a> from way back in 2012:

>“Blogging is not writing. It’s just graffiti with punctuation.”<br />

Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliot Gould) — Contagion<br /> <br />
