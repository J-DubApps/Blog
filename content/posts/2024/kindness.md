People like to say (myself included) that ‚Äúit costs nothing to be kind‚Ä¶‚Äù <br /> 

I do üíØ believe this; however... <br />

Depending on where a person is in their life and daily circumstances, the grind in life has a way leaving us almost zero energy for making the effort to stop and express kindness or empathy. People don't really have a deep well of compassion when their plate is full, or they're just trying to keep it together.  Mental health, and maintaining it in this wild world, is a thing after all. <br />

So, yeah, being kind isn't always "free" when you're stressed-out or you just have little in the proverbial tank for it. But the thing about kindness, is this: if you dig deep and find the energy to be kind, you get something back the instant you express it. Compassion is a two-way flow, and you get back what you give.  If you don't believe me, maybe just give it a shot anyway?  You may discover being kind actually reduces stress, and recharge your batteries a bit. Maybe the net effect is it ultimately DID cost you nothing to be kind.  <br />

You have to try it, to see. <br />

Being helpful or kind in life is a strength, not a weakness. In life that ultimately goes double for being kind to yourself.
