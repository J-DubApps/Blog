People like to say (myself included) that “<i>it costs nothing to be kind...”</i> <br /> 

I 💯 believe this; and *yet*... <br />

...depending on where you are in your life circumstances, the daily grind has a way of draining mental energy needed to stop and express kindness or empathy. People rarely hold a deep well of compassion as it is when their plate is full, and they're just trying to keep it together. Maintaining mental health and thick skin in a sometimes-dark world, it's a daily struggle for some people. Even the strongest people. <br />

So, yeah, being kind isn't always "free" if you're stressed-out and have nothing in the proverbial tank to express it. **But the thing about kindness, is** ***this***: if you dig deep and summon whatever energy you can to ***be kind***, you get something *back* the instant you do it. <br />

Compassion is a two-way flow, and you get back what you give. If you don't believe me, maybe just give it a shot anyway.  You might discover what other humans experience, practicing kindness: being kind reduces your anxiety and stress, and even recharges your batteries a bit. Costing you nothing in the long run, *after all*.  <br />

But you have to *try it*, to even find out. You have nothing to lose, but maybe stress and a troubled heart.  <br />

**Being helpful or kind is a ***strength*** in life, *not* a weakness**. That ultimately goes double for being kind to yourself.
