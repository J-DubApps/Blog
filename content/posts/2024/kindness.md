People like to say (myself included) that “***it costs nothing to be kind***...” <br /> 

I 💯 believe this; and *yet*... <br />

...depending on where you're at—in your life circumstances—the *daily grind* can have a way of draining mental energy needed to stop and express kindness or empathy. People rarely hold a deep well of compassion, when their plate is already full—or if they're just trying to keep it together. Maintaining mental health and thick skin, in a sometimes-dark world, it can be a daily struggle for some people. Even the *strongest* people. <br />

So, yeah, being kind isn't always "cost-*free*" if you're already stressed-out and have nothing left in the proverbial tank to express it. ***But here's the thing about kindness***: if you dig deep and summon whatever energy *you can* to ***be kind***, you get something *back* the very instant you do it. <br />

Compassion and showing empathy, where we can, becomes a *two-way* flow: ***you get back what you give***. If you don't believe me, maybe just give it a shot *anyway*.  You *might* discover what other humans experience, practicing kindness: being kind reduces your anxiety and stress, and can *even* recharge your batteries a bit. So, just maybe...kindness ultimately *costs you nothing* in the long run *after all*.  <br />

But you have to *try it*, to even find out. You have nothing to lose, but maybe a little stress.  <br />

**Remember: being helpful or kind is a ***strength*** in life, *not* a weakness**. That ultimately goes double for being kind to yourself.
