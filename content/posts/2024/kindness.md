People like to say (myself included) that ‚Äú<i>it costs nothing to be kind...‚Äù</i> <br /> 

I üíØ believe this; *however*... <br />

...depending on where a person is in their life circumstances, the daily grind has a way sucking out the energy it takes to stop and express kindness or empathy. People may not have a deep well of compassion, when their plate is full and they're just trying to keep it together. Mental health, and maintaining it in our uncertain (and sometimes dark) world, is also daily struggle for some people. Even strong people. <br />

So, yeah, being kind isn't always "free" if you're stressed-out or got little in the proverbial tank for express it. But the thing about kindness, is <b>this</b>: if you dig deep and summon the energy to be kind, you get something <i>back</i> the instant you express it. <br />

Compassion is a two-way flow, and you get back what you give. If you don't believe me, maybe just give it a shot anyway.  You may discover what other humans experience, when practicing it: being king reduces anxiety and stress, and even recharges your batteries a bit. Costing you nothing, after all.  <br />

But you have to try it, to see. You have nothing to lose, but maybe a little stress.  <br />

Being helpful or kind is a *strength* in life, not a weakness. That ultimately goes double for being kind to yourself.
