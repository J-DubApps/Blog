People like to say (myself included) that “<i>it costs nothing to be kind...”</i> <br /> 

I 💯 believe this; however... <br />

...depending on where a person is in their life circumstances, the daily grind has a way sucking the energy it takes to stop and express kindness or empathy. People may not have a deep well of compassion, when their plate is full and they're just trying to keep it together. Mental health, and maintaining it in a dark world, is a daily struggle for some people.  Even strong people. <br />

So, yeah, being kind isn't always "free" if you're stressed-out or got little in the proverbial tank for express it. But the thing about kindness, is <b>this</b>: if you dig deep and summon the energy to be kind, you get something <i>back</i> the instant you express it. Compassion is a two-way flow, and you get back what you give. If you don't believe me, maybe just give it a shot anyway.  You may discover what other humans know: being kind reduces anxiety and stress, and even recharges your batteries a bit. Costing you nothing, after all.  <br />

But you have to try it, to see. You have nothing to lose, but maybe a little stress.  <br />

Being helpful or kind is a strengt in life, not a weakness. That ultimately goes double for being kind to yourself.
