What do *Steve Jobs*, *Albert Einstein*, and *Fred Rogers* all have in common? Aside from undeniable impacts on society, they embraced the concept of a simple personal ‚Äú*uniform*‚Äù ‚Äì a singular wardrobe for the everyday. Steve Jobs was instantly recognizable in his black mock turtleneck, jeans, and New Balance sneakers. Einstein famously bought several identical versions of his favorite gray suit. And I grew up watching Fred Rogers come home from work and switch into the same cardigan and sneakers...with the occasional sweater change-up: ***a relaxed symbol of calm, kindness, and familiarity for us [GenX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X) [latchkey kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latchkey_kid) tuning-in***.

There are many "uniform wearers" out there of varying extremes (*Mark Zuckerberg* is another that comes to mind), but I have also met a lot of regular people who dress this way.  Well, maybe not *regular people*, but people that eventually pick their thing and stick with it.  It's a pattern for people who must make a lot of decisions every day. It often starts unconciously and, later, just sort of becomes their thing. <br /> 

I first thought "*uniforming*" was cartoonish and I never considered why people might dress this way. But then one day a friend reminded me that ***I*** had already been "*uniforming*" since about 1989: <br />

My "style" was always a 90s GenX low-key "punky nerd" getup.  My casual "look" since forever...

Nothing flashy. just pain jeans and [Chucks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Taylor_All-Stars), a t-shirt, and maybe sometimes a loose longs leeve shirt. And that's pretty much still me, with some tweaks as I got older. It's like meal-planning, having a simple no-fuss "uniform" on lock. But the people I mention above took it a *lot* farther. Personal styles became personal branding, and they illustrate that wearing the *same thing* daily can even *amplify* creativity and individuality. I have worked with a few busy ex-military friends who did this, and I once knew a lawyer who did the [Matlock](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matlock_(1986_TV_series)) thing, wearing similar suits all the time. In my own case, I just kept things simple and basic. I like to blend in mostly. But at some point ***JDub & THE JACKET*** emerged as my "*Winter Uniform*", and somehow became a mini-branding thing whenever consulting, giving talks, or otherwise doing PM or tech workshops during the winter months. It wasn't intentional, it's just where I comfortably ended up.

So ***THE JACKET*** is this brownish scrimmage zip-up windbreaker, with blue stitching.  I may rock different glasses or shoes, but during the winter months it's jeans and *THE JACKET*. If I have be somewhere to do something, and it's cool out (but not *COLD*)...it usually comes along with me. <br />

I purchased the *first iteration* of *THE JACKET* during a visit to see my brother & sister-in-law in Las Vegas. My wife's brother Brian had one, and I thought it looked comfortable. Cool even.  So I asked him where he bought it. Tommy Bahama. Huh?! The place I always thought only sold expensive island vacation shirts? Turns out they sell jackets and other things, and this particular jacket I *had* to have. So I proceeded to run back to the mall and get one in black, but it turned-out to have a couple of defects.  Returning it, I found that they only had the popular brown jacket to swap out.  And that is how "JDub & *THE JACKET*" came to be. Every mild Texas winter, I'm rocking this getup until March or April. üòé

I wore *THE JACKET* pretty much everywhere over the years.  While fat or thin...while tired or rested...in different eras of hair style (and with a little grey now): unless there was a blizard this was my "winter getup" for the past 18 years...

*THE JACKET* has been to almost every major US city and parts of Europe. Same jacket. Same me. Just older, but [*time is a flat circle*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKRksnjSxWI) anyway. üôÉü§ì  When I lost weight, eBay came in clutch with unsold stock, allowing me to keep my winter "uniform" into perpetuity.  I now have three of these, and friends joke I will probably be *buried* in *THE JACKET*.  Maybe. I still wear the original jacket the most, it's perfectly worn-in like a comfortable pair of slippers.  The newer jackets go to work and other functions.

IT work generally allows casual dress, especially data center work and late-hour coding sprints.  Anytime I was out and about for work in a *cool-not-cold* environment, it's been *THE JACKET* and me...

Flash-forward to last week, and my wife observes: "hey, you've been wearing that jacket for like almost 20 years now."

And she's right, though I think it was more *commentary* than observation. ü§î  So it turns out about 18 years in *THE JACKET* just kind of flew by...

#### Over the years I have found that a basic no frills "*uniform*" offers some advantages: <br />
1.	**Cognitive Clarity**: By eliminating daily decisions, about anything, you conserve mental energy for more critical tasks. Psychologists refer to this as reducing ‚Äú*decision fatigue*,‚Äù a phenomenon where making too many choices depletes your cognitive resources.  Deciding what to wear is one cognitive load that "*uniform wearers*" don't want, so they skip it.<br />
2.	**Branding**: A consistent style can become your visual signature, making you immediately identifiable.  It doesn't have to be a "uniform" but is usually a narrow range of clothing you're pre-selecting.  Either way, that becomes *you* whenever you are showing-up somewhere to work with a team, give a presentation, etc. <br />
3.	***Invisibility On Demand***: Ironically, a uniform not only makes you recognizable but also grants you some selective invisibility: if I want to blend-in at a tech conference or other busy place, I just pop on another jacket or shirt. *Poof*! I'm everywhere and *nowhere*... üôÉ <br />
<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 9px;"><img src="https://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/2024/BrownJacket/jdub-blue-jacket.jpeg" alt="Alt text" width="275" height="135"> <br />
<i>Who is this?  Where did JDub go? </i></div><br />
4.	**Minimalism Meets Practicality**: Fewer clothing options mean *fewer* distractions, *less* clutter, and a focus on quality over quantity. It‚Äôs long been my lifestyle to stay rooted in efficiency and intentionality, wherever I can.

So whether you‚Äôre reclaiming mental energy or just craving *simplicity*, the *uniform thing* is an age-old method that may provide those benefits. Ultimately the trick to pulling it off is to be casual and not focus on the *sameness*, in the first place (*oops*). At the end of the day, it‚Äôs really not really about the clothes anyway‚Äîit‚Äôs about the person *wearing them*.
