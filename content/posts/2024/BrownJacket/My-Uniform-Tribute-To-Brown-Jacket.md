What do Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, and Fred Rogers have in common? Aside from undeniable impacts on society, they all embraced the concept of an easy personal ‚ÄúUniform‚Äù ‚Äì a singular wardrobe worn every day. Steve Jobs was instantly recognizable in the black mock turtleneck, jeans, and New Balance sneakers. Einstein famously bought several versions of the same gray suit. And I grew up watching Fred Rogers wear the same cardigan and snweakers, with the occasional jacket color change. -- a relaxed symbol of kindness and familiarity, for us Gen-X latchkey kids tuning-in.  There are others (Simon Cowell with black t-shirts, or Mark Zuckerberg with his gray T-shirt and hoodie, etc), and it seems a pattern with people who have to make a lot of decisions every day. They unconciously (and later, intentionally) develop their own "uniform" to simplify their lives, while also building a personal brand and creating a lasting impression on people working around them. <br />

I always thought the idea of wearing the same thing every day was a silly concept, until one day in 1999 a friend told me that I was wearing roughly the same outfit since 1987: <br />

So I already had a very simple wardrobe, a small range of clothes that "*are* ***me***". And I had no idea that was the case.  The people I mentiioned earlier illustrate that wearing the same thing doesn‚Äôt diminish creativity or individuality‚Äîand can even amplify these things.  And, in my own case, the ""***JDub & THE JACKET***" became a thing almost 20 years ago. But only seasonal. That right, this Old Bro You Know rocks the same "look" almost every day, from about Octobber until March each year. Sometimes with different shoes or glasses, but always jeans and THE JACKET.  If I have be somewwhere to give a presetation or talk, or just show-up for a quickly-scheduled dinner hang...THE JACKET getup is what you're gonna see.<br />

I found THE JACKET during one of our many visits to my brother & sister-in-law's place in Las Vegas. I think it was 2007 and my wife's brother Brian bought this brown scrimmage zip-up jacket at Tommy Bahama, a place yours-truly hadn't buy anything from. I always thought it was expensive, and a little dull, but for whatever reason Brian bought this jacket that I decided was hella cool.  After a day or so I decided I will have one.  So I walked into the Tommy Bahamma store and snagged the jacket in black.  But it turned-out to have a couple of defects, so I took it back and all they to swap was the popular brown jacket.  And that is how "JDub & THE JACKET" came to be.  Every mild Teas winter you'll see me rocking that look, and too many others until March or April. üòé <br />

I wore it everywhere, while fat and thin...while tired and rested...while young and middle-aged. Between October and March of any given yeaer, this is me...

I've worn this jacket to every major US city and parts of Europe.  Same jacket.  Same me.   lways, at least until recently -- when I lost some weight, and wanted to see if I could get another one.   Sure enough, eBay came in clutch and I found some unsold stock of my very jacket.  So now I have two.  I still wear the old one, it's like a comfortable place to be for me.  But I wear the newer one to work or other functions.   

Flash-forward to last week, December '24, and my wife observed: "hey, you've been wearing this jacket for like 15 years now!"

This deliberate wardrobe choice offers some advantages: <br />
1.	Cognitive Clarity: By eliminating daily decisions, about anything, you conserve mental energy for more critical tasks. Psychologists refer to this as reducing ‚Äúdecision fatigue,‚Äù a phenomenon where making too many choices depletes your cognitive resources.  Deciding what to wear is a cognitive load, one that "Uniform" wearers don't want.
2.	Branding: A consistent style can become your visual signature, making you immediately identifiable. Jobs‚Äô turtleneck wasn‚Äôt just a shirt‚Äîit was a symbol of innovation, focus, and the Apple ethos.
3.	Invisibility On Demand: Ironically, a uniform not only makes you recognizable but also grants the power of selective invisibility. Want to blend in? Swap your iconic look for something nondescript, and you‚Äôll likely be overlooked as your ‚Äúnormal self‚Äù isn‚Äôt in view.
4.	Minimalism Meets Practicality: Fewer clothing options mean fewer distractions, less clutter, and a focus on quality over quantity. It‚Äôs a lifestyle rooted in efficiency and intentionality.
