What do Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, and Fred Rogers have in common? Aside from their undeniable impact in their fields, they all embraced the concept of a ‚Äúuniform‚Äù ‚Äì a singularly-similar wardrobe worn every day. Steve Jobs was instantly recognizable in his black mock turtleneck, blue jeans, and New Balance sneakers, and and Einstein famously bought several versions of the same gray suit, declaring, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to waste brainpower on clothes.‚Äù  I grew up watching Fred Rogers wear the same cardigan and snweakers, with the occasional jacket color change -- but almost always the same overall relaxed and approachable "look", he became a symbol of kindness and familiarity for us Gen-X latchkey kids.  There are others like Simon Cowell with black t-shirts and Mark Zuckerberg with his gray T-shirt and hoodie.  Each of those individuals somehow unconciously (and later, intentionally) created their own "uniform" to simplify their lives, while also building a personal brand and creating a lasting impression on people working around them. <br />

To me, always wearing the same thing seemed goofy in concept.  But the people I just mentiion above demonstrated something: wearing the same thing doesn‚Äôt diminish creativity or individuality‚Äîand it can even amplify these things.  But in my case, well...it just ended up random that "JDub & THE JACKET" became a thing almost 20 years ago.  But only seasonal.  That right, this Old Bro You Know rocks the same "look" almost every day, from about Octobber until March each year. Sometimes with different shoes or glasses, but usually it's the Lunor Runds, Chuck Taylors, jeans, and THE JACKET.  If I gotta be somewwhere to give a presetation or talk, or just show-up for a quickly-scheduled dinner hang...THE JACKET is what you're gonna get.<br />

I found THE JACKET during one of my many visits to see my bro & sister-in-laws in Las Vegas. Somewhere around 2006, my brother-on-law Brian and my wife were shopping, and I tagged along.  He bought this brown scrimmage zip-up jacket at Tommy Bahama, a place yours-truly doesn't realy shop much. I always thought it was expensive, and a little dull, but for whatever reason Brian bought this jacket that I decided was hella cool.  After a day or so I decided I must have one.  So I marched into Tommy Bahamma and snagged on in black.  But it turned-out to have a couple of defects, so I took it back and all they to swap was the popular brown jacket.  And that is how "JDub & THE JACKET" came to be.  Every mild Teas winter you'll see me rocking that look, and too many others until March or April. üòé <br />

I wore it everywhere, while fat and thin...while tired and rested...while young and middle-aged. Between October and March of any given yeaer, this is me...

I've worn this jacket to every major US city and parts of Europe.  Same jacket.  Same me.   lways, at least until recently -- when I lost some weight, and wanted to see if I could get another one.   Sure enough, eBay came in clutch and I found some unsold stock of my very jacket.  So now I have two.  I still wear the old one, it's like a comfortable place to be for me.  But I wear the newer one to work or other functions.   

Flash-forward to last week, December '24, and my wife observed: "hey, you've been wearing this jacket for two decades now!" 

Long after my brother-in
This deliberate wardrobe choice offers profound advantages: <br />
1.	Cognitive Clarity: By eliminating daily decisions about what to wear, you conserve mental energy for more critical tasks. Psychologists refer to this as reducing ‚Äúdecision fatigue,‚Äù a phenomenon where making too many choices depletes your cognitive resources.
	2.	Branding: A consistent style can become your visual signature, making you immediately identifiable. Jobs‚Äô turtleneck wasn‚Äôt just a shirt‚Äîit was a symbol of innovation, focus, and the Apple ethos. Similarly, Anna Wintour‚Äôs sunglasses and bob are as iconic as her magazine covers.
	3.	Invisibility On Demand: Ironically, a uniform not only makes you recognizable but also grants the power of selective invisibility. Want to blend in? Swap your iconic look for something nondescript, and you‚Äôll likely be overlooked as your ‚Äúnormal self‚Äù isn‚Äôt in view.
	4.	Minimalism Meets Practicality: Fewer clothing options mean fewer distractions, less clutter, and a focus on quality over quantity. It‚Äôs a lifestyle rooted in efficiency and intentionality.
