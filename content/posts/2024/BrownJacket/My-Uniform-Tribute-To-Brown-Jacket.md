What do *Steve Jobs*, *Albert Einstein*, and *Fred Rogers* all have in common? Aside from undeniable impacts on society, they embraced the concept of a simple personal ‚Äú*uniform*‚Äù ‚Äì a singular wardrobe for the everyday. Steve Jobs was instantly recognizable in his black mock turtleneck, jeans, and New Balance sneakers. Einstein famously bought several identical versions of his favorite gray suit. I grew up watching Fred Rogers wear the same cardigan and sneakers, with the occasional jacket color change: a relaxed symbol of calm, kindness, and familiarity for us [GenX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X) [latchkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latchkey_kid) kids tuning-in.

There are many "uniform wearers" out there (*Simon Cowell* and *Mark Zuckerberg*, to name two more), and probably even more regular doing it.  It is a pattern for people who must make a lot of decisions every day. It often starts unconciously and, later, just sort of becomes an intentional thing.  I never considered why people might wear the same thing most every day, and it seemed unrealistic to me.  But then one day a friend told me that ***I*** had been "*uniforming*" since about 1989: <br />

My "style" was always 90s GenX low-key, kind of a punky nerd getup and my casual "look" since forever...

Nothing flashy. I like to blend in: just plain jeans and Chucks, a plain t-shirt, and sometimes a loose longsleeve shirt or light coat. And that's pretty much still me these days, with a few changes as I got older. It's like meal-planning, having my own simple no-fuss "uniform" on lock. But the people I mention above took it a lot farther in their daily lives. Personal styles became personal branding, and they illustrated that wearing the same thing each day probably even *amplified* creativity and individuality. Everyday people may roll a "uniform", too, like a few busy ex-military friends I have worked with. In my own case I always liked to keep it simple and basic, and some time ago my defacto "*Winter uniform*" changed. ***JDub & THE JACKET*** emerged as my own personal look when consulting, giving talks, or otherwise doing anything involving PM or tech presentations during the winter months. It wasn't intentional, but that's how it evolved.

So *THE JACKET* is this brownish light scrimmage zip-up windbreaker, with blue-stitching.  I may rock different glasses or shoes, but during the winter months it's jeans and *THE JACKET*. If I have be somewhere to do something, and it's cool out (but not *COLD*)...it usually comes along with me. <br />

I purchased the *first iteration* of *THE JACKET* during a visit to see my brother & sister-in-law in Las Vegas. My wife's brother Brian bought one, and I thought it looked comfortable. Cool even.  So I asked him where he bought it. Tommy Bahama.  Huh?  The place I always thought just sold expensive island vacation shirts? Turns out they made jackets and other things, and this particular jacket was one I had to get. So I proceeded to run back to the mall and get one in black, but it turned-out to have a couple of defects.  Returning it, I found that they only had the popular brown jacket to swap out.  And that is how "JDub & *THE JACKET*" came to be. Every mild Texas winter, I'm rocking this getup until March or April. üòé

I wore *THE JACKET* pretty much everywhere over the years.  While fat or thin...while tired or rested...in different eras of hair style (and with a little grey now): unless there was a blizard this was my "winter getup" for the past 18 years...

*THE JACKET* has been to almost every major US city and parts of Europe. Same jacket. Same me. Just older, but [*time is a flat circle*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKRksnjSxWI) anyway. üôÉü§ì  When I lost weight, eBay came in clutch with unsold stock, allowing me to keep my "uniform" into perpetuity.  I now have three of these, and my friends joke I will probably be *buried* in *THE JACKET*.  I still wear the old one the most, it's perfectly worn-in like a comfortable pair of slippers.  The newer jackets go with me to work or other functions.

IT work always allowed casual dress, especially data center work and late-hour coding sprints.  Anytime I was out and about for work, it's been *THE JACKET* and me...

Flash-forward to last week, and my wife observes: "hey, you've been wearing that jacket for like almost 20 years now."

And she's right, though I think it was more *commentary* than observation. ü§î  So it turns out about 18 years in *THE JACKET* just kind of flew by...

#### Over the years I have found that a basic no frills "*uniform*" offers some advantages: <br />
1.	**Cognitive Clarity**: By eliminating daily decisions, about anything, you conserve mental energy for more critical tasks. Psychologists refer to this as reducing ‚Äú*decision fatigue*,‚Äù a phenomenon where making too many choices depletes your cognitive resources.  Deciding what to wear is one cognitive load that "*uniform wearers*" don't want, so they skip it.<br />
2.	**Branding**: A consistent style can become your visual signature, making you immediately identifiable.  It doesn't have to be a "uniform" but is usually a narrow range of clothing you're pre-selecting.  Either way, that becomes *you* whenever you are showing-up somewhere to work with a team, give a presentation, etc. <br />
3.	***Invisibility On Demand***: Ironically, a uniform not only makes you recognizable but also grants you some selective invisibility: if I want to blend-in at a tech conference or other busy place, I just pop on another jacket or shirt. *Poof*! I'm everywhere and *nowhere*... üôÉ <br />
 <img src="https://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/2024/BrownJacket/jdub-blue-jacket.jpeg" alt="Alt text" width="275" height="135"> <br />
4.	**Minimalism Meets Practicality**: Fewer clothing options mean *fewer* distractions, *less* clutter, and a focus on quality over quantity. It‚Äôs been my lifestyle to stay rooted in efficiency and intentionality, wherever I can.

So whether you‚Äôre reclaiming mental energy or just simply craving *simplicity*, the *uniform thing* has been around forever and has some undeniable benefits. Ultimately the trick to pulling it off is to be casual and not focus on it, in the first place (*oops*). After all, it‚Äôs not really about the clothes‚Äîit‚Äôs about the person *wearing them*.
