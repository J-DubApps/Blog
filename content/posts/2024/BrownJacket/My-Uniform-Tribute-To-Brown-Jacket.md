What do *Steve Jobs*, *Albert Einstein*, and *Fred Rogers* allhave in common? Aside from undeniable impacts on society, they embraced the concept of an easy personal “*uniform*” – a singular wardrobe worn every day. Steve Jobs was instantly recognizable in the black mock turtleneck, jeans, and New Balance sneakers. Einstein famously bought several identical versions of his favorite gray suit. I grew up watching Fred Rogers wear the same cardigan and sneakers, with the occasional jacket color change: a relaxed symbol of calm, kindness, and familiarity for us [GenX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X) [latchkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latchkey_kid) kids tuning-in.  There are other "uniform wearers" out there (*Simon Cowell* and *Mark Zuckerberg*, to name two), and it's a pattern for people who must make a lot of decisions every day. It starts unconciously and, later, intentionally as it becomes their personal brand and a lasting impression on people working around them.

I never considered why people might wear the same thing most every day, then one day a friend told me I had been wearing the same thing since about 1990: <br />

My "style" was always the GenX low-key, punky nerd look which was my main getup for many years...

And that's pretty much me these days, with a few change-ups as I got older. I already had a simple no fuss "uniform" look on lock, but the people I mention above took it a lot farther.  And they illustrated that wearing the same thing, each day, doesn’t affect creativity or individuality—it can even *amplify* these things. In my own case, my simple duds got a tweak for the mild Texas winter weather, and it became my defacto "*Winter uniform*": ***JDub & THE JACKET***.  It turned into my personal "brand" or look when consulting, giving talks, or otherwise doing anything involving PM and tech projects during the winter months.  <br /> 

So *THE JACKET* is this brownish scrimmage zip-up jacket with blue-stitching.  I may rock different glasses or shoes, but during the winter months it's jeans and *THE JACKET*. If I have be somewhere to give a presentation or talk, or if I just need to show-up somewhere quickly and it's cool out...*THE JACKET* is probably coming along with me (or on me).

I purchased the first iteration of *THE JACKET* during a visit to see my brother & sister-in-law in Las Vegas. My wife's brother Brian bought one, and I thought it looked comfrotable. Cool even.  So I asked him where he bought it. Tommy Bahama.  Huh?  A place yours-truly never considered for clothing, since I always thought they were just an expensive island vacation shirt place. Turns out they made jackets and other things, and this particular jacket was one I wanted to get. So I proceeded to run back to the mall and get one in black, but it turned-out to have a couple of defects.  Returning it, I found that they only had the popular brown jacket to swap out.  And that is how "JDub & *THE JACKET*" came to be. Every mild Texas winter, I'm rocking this getup until March or April. 😎

I wore *THE JACKEET* pretty much everywhere over the years.  While fat and thin...while tired and rested...in different eras of hair style...and while young and, now, *less-young*. Unless there was a blizard, this was my "winter getup" for the past 18 years...

*THE JACKET* has been to almost every major US city, and parts of Europe by now. Same jacket. Same me. Just older.  [*Time is a flat circle*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKRksnjSxWI). 🙃🤓  When I lost weight, eBay came in clutch with unsold stock, allowing me to keep my "uniform" into perpetuity.  I now have three of these, and my friends joke I will probably be buried in *THE JACKET*.  I still wear the old one the most, it's worn-in like a comfortable pair of gloves.  The newer jackets go with me to work or other functions.

Anytime I was out and about on a mild winter day, no big coats...just *THE JACKET*...

Flash-forward to last week, and my wife observes: "hey, you've been wearing this jacket for like almost 20 years now."

It was more *commentary* than observation, I think. 🤔 And she's right, turns out about 18 years in *THE JACKET* have gone by...it became my own "personal brand" for IT and PM conferences, or whatever else I was doing in the tech world.

#### Over the years I have found that a basic no frills wardrobe offers some advantages: <br />
1.	**Cognitive Clarity**: By eliminating daily decisions, about anything, you conserve mental energy for more critical tasks. Psychologists refer to this as reducing “*decision fatigue*,” a phenomenon where making too many choices depletes your cognitive resources.  Deciding what to wear is a cognitive load, one that "uniform" wearers don't want.<br />
2.	**Branding**: A consistent style can become your visual signature, making you immediately identifiable.  It doesn't have to be a "uniform" but is usually a narrow range of clothing or style/look.  Either way, that becomes *you* whenever you are showing-up somewhere to work with a team, give a presentation, etc. <br />
3.	***Invisibility On Demand***: Ironically, a uniform not only makes you recognizable but also grants you some selective invisibility. If I want to blend-in at a tech conference or other busy place, I just pop on another jacket or shirt. *Poof*! I'm everywhere and *nowhere*... 🙃 <br />
 <img src="https://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/2024/BrownJacket/jdub-blue-jacket.jpeg" alt="Alt text" width="275" height="135"> <br />
4.	**Minimalism Meets Practicality**: Fewer clothing options mean *fewer* distractions, *less* clutter, and a focus on quality over quantity. It’s been my lifestyle to stay rooted in efficiency and intentionality, wherever I can.

So whether you’re reclaiming mental energy or just simply craving *simplicity*, the *uniform thing* has been around forever and has some undeniable benefits. Ultimately the trick to pulling it off is to not draw attention to the fact that you're wearing the same thing a lot.  After all, it’s not really about the clothes—it’s about the person *wearing them*.
