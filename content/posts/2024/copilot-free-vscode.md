[GitHub Copilot is now free in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/12/18/free-github-copilot), so if you skipped on Copilot the past year or so, there's no financial commitment to get in there and check out Copilot coding workflows in VS Code now. <br />

With so much emerging competition in the IDE space ([Zed etc](https://zed.dev)), this is a smart move by Microsoft to keep VS Code as a center of dev toolibg-focus. <br />

GitHub isn't super clear on specific [differences in the free tier](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/subscription-plans-for-github-copilot), other than to say it's "limited access to select features" of Copilot. But not having a subscription is great.  Be sure and check it out! <br />

**UPDATE**: Here's a video walk-through --
