No thanks, Elmo.<br />

A lot of water has passed under the bridge since I first reserved the CyberTruck when it was announced. And while most of us old ancient early Tesla investors and early customers have been disappointed by past / recent behavior of the CEO, my main reason has nothing really to do with that.  The CyberTrucks I have experienced in person just seemed to no really excite me.  I test-drove a friend's CT, rode in a couple of others, and I think this kind of vehicle just isn't for me.  Tesla is also having some birthing issues with this first year CT, as well, but overall I am just not into the truck.  If I'm being honest, I wasn't really ever into it when they unveiled it. If I do ever end up rolling an EV truck, it would probably be a Rivian or Ford F-150 Lightning.  But to each their own.  Peace!
