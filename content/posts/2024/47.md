For any commentary or thoughts, I simply refer you <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/45/">my November 9, 2016 blog post from 8 years ago.</a>.  It's the same identical situation, second term or no.<br /> 

A lot may have happened in the past 8 years, but nothing has changed: one party endlessly does identity politics and will "be right" all the way to the grave, while the other party understands that majorities in this country have always voted 100% with their wallets.<br />

Rinse.  Repeat.  Maybe they'll learn. /shrug
