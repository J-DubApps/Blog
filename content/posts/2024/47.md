For any commentary or thoughts, I simply refer you <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/45/">my November 9, 2016 blog post from 8 years ago</a>.  It's the same identical situation, just with a 4 year intermission, I think.<br /> 

A lot may have <i>happened</i> in the past 8 years, but also nothing much has <i>changed</i>: one party still endlessly does identity politics and will "be right" all the way to the grave, and the other party understands that majorities in this country have always voted with their wallets.<br />

Rinse.  Repeat. /shrug<br />
