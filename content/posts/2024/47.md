For any commentary or thoughts, I simply refer you <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/45/">my November 9, 2016 blog post from 8 years ago</a>.  It all still applies and is nearly the same event, just with a 4 year intermission...<br /> 

A lot may have <i>happened</i> in the past 8 years, but also nothing <i>much</i> has actually <i>changed</i> either: one party still endlessly does identity politics and will "be right"â€”losing elections all the way to the grave.  And the other party understands that majorities in this country have always voted with their wallets. <br />

Rinse.  Repeat. /shrug <br />
