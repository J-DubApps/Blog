In a world where technology can enable companies to track every click, keystroke, or chat log, it’s tempting for organizations to think that intense monitoring is the path to managing a productive workforce. [According to one Apple employee's recent lawsuit](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311060/apple-employee-surveillance-lawsuit), some Apple middle-managers have given-in to this fallacy.  Yet worker-surveillance often causes more harm than good: it can corrode trust, disempower employees, and shift leadership’s attention to the ***wrong metrics***.  I am going to explore how tech workers tend to face measures of productivity that are deceptively shallow, and why misguided data collection can backfire.  And, most importantly, why you should be hiring people you trust in the first place.

### The Mirage of In-Person “FaceTime” as a Productivity Heuristic

One of the oldest faux-productivity yardsticks is the notion of “face time.” In a traditional office, there’s an assumption that when people are physically present—seated at their desks or strolling the halls—they’re producing results. Yet we’ve all seen how easy it is to fake “busy-ness” without actually getting meaningful work done:<br />
•	**Present Yet Unproductive** – Employees can linger in the office, attend every meeting, and manage to do relatively little of value. The mere fact that you see them doesn’t prove they’re getting things done. Employees knowing there is technology in place watching them (and they always *figure it out*) usually leads to a common outcome: [***quiet-quitting***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule#Quiet_quitting).  <br />
•	**Illusion of Control** – Some managers feel more “in control” when they can physically see people working, but it’s really a comfort blanket. This visual check-in doesn’t guarantee any actual accomplishments. <br />
•	**Remote Work Blowback** – Ironically, many workplaces scrutinize remote workers more heavily because managers can’t see them. In reality, if the focus is on ***deliverables***, remote professionals *often outperform* peers who are skilled at appearing busy in person. <br /> <br />

In short, face time is just a simple ***heuristic***—*not* a real measure of productivity. It's just a *guess* based on *presence*, and **if you rely on it, you risk micromanagement instead of** ***meaningful engagement***. <br />

### “You Can’t Value What You Don’t Measure”—But Measure *Thoughtfully*

A truism that I say a lot is: “*You can’t value what you don’t measure*” -- and it underscores that an organization must track certain metrics to gauge outcomes. *However*, what we measure *should align* with ***actual business value and meaningful results***. Here is what I mean, by this: <br />
•	**Identify the Real Goals** – Before putting any surveillance technology in place, step back and ask: What are the real goals of the work my team does? These goals might be sales revenue, product launches, research breakthroughs, or delivering quality service—things that can be tracked through performance outcomes, *not* "*time-watching*". <br />
•	**Outcomes Over Outputs** – Instead of fixating on how many hours someone is seated in their home office or how many lines of code they wrote, measure whether the project was completed successfully, on budget, and on time. <br />
•	**Use Tools, Not Tracking** – There are plenty of project management tools that help clarify roles, deadlines, and responsibilities. These facilitate collaboration *and accountability* without verging into invasive surveillance. <br /><br />

In other words: **measure the outcomes that *genuinely* matter to the business**, rather than pulling in a torrent of data that may not translate to real impact (or actual true understanding of employee output). <br />

### “What Gets Measured, Gets Managed”—So Choose the *Right* Metrics

*Another* truism that I like to say a lot is: “*What Gets Measured, Gets Managed*”.  And, like the concept above, **if you're measuring the *wrong* things: you're probably *managing* the wrong things**. <br />

When leaders measure an activity, their energy (and their entire team’s energy) goes into optimizing that metric, sometimes to the detriment of other more vital considerations. This can lead to so-called “teaching to the test”—where employees figure out how to do well on the metric being measured rather than actually producing high-quality results.
•	**Quality vs. Quantity** – Focusing on high-output metrics (e.g., lines of code, number of calls handled) might overlook the quality of the work. <br />
•	**Innovative vs. Safe** – If your metric punishes mistakes rather than assessing overall innovation, you’ll discourage the kind of risk-taking that might lead to genuine breakthroughs. <br />
•	**Short-Term vs. Long-Term** – Some metrics measure short-term wins but undermine strategic planning and long-term investments. Over-monitoring can drive employees to meet daily or weekly targets, neglecting bigger-picture initiatives. <br />

Leaders should (no, *must*) think critically about which metrics will help drive success, not just create "busy-ness". If you’re measuring hours logged in a time-tracking tool, for example, you might get employees who are good at clocking hours but not necessarily at delivering results. <br />

### Why Are You Hiring People You Think You Need to Surveil?

At the heart of anti-surveillance thinking is a simple question: If you don’t trust the people you hire, why did you hire them in the first place?
	•	Erosion of Trust – Once you implement intrusive surveillance, you send a clear message: “I believe you might slack off if I’m not watching.” This undermines the trust-based contract that encourages employees to be loyal, creative, and engaged.
	•	Turnover & Talent Drain – Skilled professionals prefer workplaces where they’re treated with autonomy and respect. Surveillance-heavy cultures risk driving the best talent elsewhere.
	•	Opportunity Cost – Time and resources spent on building and managing surveillance systems could be reallocated to leadership development, improved processes, or benefits that actually boost morale and productivity.

Building a culture of trust and accountability is more effective in the long run than controlling people’s every digital move. People who feel trusted are more willing to tackle challenges proactively, communicate openly about obstacles, and go the extra mile.
