Dearest Jackson,
The moment we first met you, you stood up on two legs and raised a paw to greet Kimberly. It was like you recognized her. It was like you picked us.
You were maybe 8 or 9 months old. Just quietly hanging out, while all the other dogs were noisy and barking in their crates. It was October 4th, 2003. Your crate had your name on it: Jackson. We instantly wanted to take you home with us, but you were on-hold for an adoption. We were crushed. We spent a little more time with you, then we had to say goodbye.<br /><br />
I called that shelter twice a day for a week. Your reservation date came and wentâ€¦and we drove two hours to come get you and take you home with us. I am still trying to find words, to explain just how happy you made us that day nearly 15 years ago. I will never forget it.<br /><br />
I remember the first few days when you settled into your new home. You were pretty quiet and reserved for a puppy. Too quiet, until we found those perfect chew toys and tug-ropes for you. Then you really let loose. I think Mr Carrot, and his 4 incarnations over the years, will miss you especially. Pink Pig and Blue Snake will miss you as well.<br /><br />

You were so whip-smart. You could fetch those toys just by hearing their nicknames. It took all of 20 minutes to teach you to sit and speak, though I am pretty sure you stretched it out a bit for the extra treats. And we learned just how strong and wild you could really be when you discovered squirrels and rabbits on those early neighborhood walks.<br /><br />
