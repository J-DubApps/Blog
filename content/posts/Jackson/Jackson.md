Dearest Jackson,
The moment we first met you, you stood up on two legs and raised a paw to greet Kimberly. It was like you recognized her. It was like you picked us.
You were maybe 8 or 9 months old. Just quietly hanging out, while all the other dogs were noisy and barking in their crates. It was October 4th, 2003. Your crate had your name on it: Jackson. We instantly wanted to take you home with us, but you were on-hold for an adoption. We were crushed. We spent a little more time with you, then we had to say goodbye.<br /><br />
I called that shelter twice a day for a week. Your reservation date came and went…and we drove two hours to come get you and take you home with us. I am still trying to find words, to explain just how happy you made us that day nearly 15 years ago. I will never forget it.<br /><br />
I remember the first few days when you settled into your new home. You were pretty quiet and reserved for a puppy. Too quiet, until we found those perfect chew toys and tug-ropes for you. Then you really let loose. I think Mr Carrot, and his 4 incarnations over the years, will miss you especially. Pink Pig and Blue Snake will miss you as well.<br /><br />

You were so whip-smart. You could fetch those toys just by hearing their nicknames. It took all of 20 minutes to teach you to sit and speak, though I am pretty sure you stretched it out a bit for the extra treats. And we learned just how strong and wild you could really be when you discovered squirrels and rabbits on those early neighborhood walks.<br /><br />

Speaking of nicknames, Mommy gave you many, and you answered them them all: Pumpkin, Pookie Bear, Little One. You were very generous and never offended at the names, you even wagged your tail at hearing them.<br /><br />
You knew whenever I called out “Mister Jukes!!” from across the house it was play-time, and I would hear your paws scampering down the hallway. I can hear those paws making tracks RIGHT NOW, clear as day. Mommy loved to play hide & seek all the time with you around the house, and you ALWAYS found her. I remember how you always hated loud thunder or fireworks, and how you barked and whimpered at the noise. Hold the puppy, hold the scary noise at bay, live for that thankful face lick when the storm passes. Even when storms were no longer scary, you still gave out those licks. It was so fun watching you figure stuff out and see you grow up.<br /><br />
And we grew up with you, too, Jackson. You were there for our big life changes: getting married, buying our first house, getting through losing two parents. And you changed one guy’s cold heart, during all those firsts. You and Mommy got me out of my own head, settled me down and made me loosen-up and live a little. And you filled our house with such great noise: collar tag jingles, proud and loud barks, the zoom-runs across the floor when it was time for a walk. You helped us make our house a home. Thank you.<br /><br />

And that bark! I can still hear your bark right here and now, as I struggle to write this. “Time to go for a walk!” and your excitement was vocal. You had an attention bark, a snack-request bark, a Mailman bark, you name it. You never had a problem getting our attention. You also never had a problem getting anybody else’s attention either: you took your watchdog duties very seriously. Inspection of all guests was mandatory, and woe to anybody who made sudden or odd movements around your pack, they got checked. You could be serious, goofy, and loving within the span of a few minutes. You made us laugh and smile so much all these years, Jackson.<br /> <br />
