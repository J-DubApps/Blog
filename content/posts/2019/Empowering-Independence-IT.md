In a dynamic world of IT Systems Ops and DevOps, effective cross-training is a always challenge. Skill-ups are essential for both individual growth *and* team success. Over many years of experience as a PM, manager, and mentor, I have developed a philosophy that emphasizes: ***self-reliance, initiative, and continuous learning***. Found below will be my personal manifesto on cross-training, my contribution to developing proficient and empowered teams. <br />

### Teaching the *WHERE* or the *WHAT*, ***Not*** Always the *WHY* or the *HOW*

I can provide you with the ***WHERE***â€”the documentation, server information, IP addresses, and other essential resources. ***However***, I may not always have the time to delve into the ***WHY*** behind every decision or the ***HOW*** of every process. We are so busy everyday documenting the ***WHAT*** and the ***WHERE*** items I describe above, that it leaves precious *little-to-no* time for ever documenting (or explaining) exact click-by-click or CLI ***HOW*** steps to complete a task, or get an outcome: that is where *your own skills-growth* must rise to the occasion.  <br /> 

I am talking about [**First Principles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) training, fundamentals which always cover the *Why* of a thing.  Not the *other* kind of *Why* [that may come up in our jobs](https://julianwest.me/Blog/start-with-why/), like motivation or reason for something is being done.  **First Principles** are needed, before any mentor can really help you in ***the knowing*** of the *How* and *Why* of something you are learning.  The nuances of our systems and the depth of understanding come from *hands-on experience*, your own personal initiative, and ***time***. While I can guide you to resources and sometimes briefly go over fundamentals about a technology or tool, uncovering the *why* and *how* is ultimately ***your*** journey: and that journey must involve personal exploration and practice, sometimes on your own time. I cannot do it for you. Taking your own time to push through learning **First PrincipleS** is how you get *started* at anything in this line of work, and the first steps to getting *good* at anything in tech!  If you put in your time on basics, *same as everybody else*, then you will find the peer-help you want,  is more readily-available to you.  Learning is a flow between ***personal time invested*** *and* collaboration: never one or the other. <br />

But many people always want ALL learning to be collaborative: I'm sorry, it's just not. Putting in the time (...to build your own lab, code your own Powershell script, or configure your own network/server gear) are how you *get* the fundamentals of this stuff. To be able to *know enough* to ask the right questions, to *learn more*.  And if you don't have that kind of time (and I get it, I truly do) to uncover the *why* and *how* of stuff -- you at least owe it to your teammates to train-up to a point where you can at least use system Documentation (the *where* and the *what*) as best you can.  Just understand, if you don't have time for skillset-growth in an area -- no one owes you their time away from their own tasks...to help you fill in *all* the blanks, *all* of the time.

### Setting Clear Expectations and Providing Support

We're all adults and professionals here, and I trust in your ability to take ownership of your tasks and your ***fundamental skills-development***, just as important as any *personal-development* in the IT world. I will set clear expectations for outcomes, and ensure you have the tools and support you need; ***however***, I expect you to begin your work ***without*** requiring immediate step-by-step guidance, hand-holding, or needing numerous question asked/answered right from the start.  **Dive in *first***: explore and take the initiative to solve problems independently, and that leads to *better* support from your manager or local SME.  In Enterprise IT and DevOps, your performance is *directly-measured* by outcomes and accountability.  Part of accountability is working *independently* (at least *at first*) toward a needed result. Fair or not, being a self-starter is *your currency* for being able to call-in *enthusiastic* support and assistance from other skilled team members.

### Embracing Challenges and Seeking Help When You Get Truly Stuck

**Challenges are opportunities for growth**. I encourage you to tackle obstacles head-on and make a genuine effort to overcome them. If you find yourself truly stuck after exhausting your resources, I'm more than happy to assist. But remember, when you come to me for help, I will always ask what you've already tried first. This approach ensures you're actively engaged in the problem-solving process and promotes learning. <br />

Remember that independently trying ***first*** is <u>***everything***</u> in troubleshooting and learning: joyfully get *stuck*, because *that* is where the learning happens and where ***geeks like myself*** get motivated to enthusiastically help!  If you ask for help without having tried much (without *getting stuck* ***first***) we're going to have a chat, or you're probably going to receive this blog post. ðŸ˜‚  <br />

**Pro Tip**: The secret about getting *enthusiastic support* from your local SME or uber nerd is--*trying to solve the problem independently*, and be ok (even excited) to *get stuck first* before firing-off an email thread or asking for help.  If you operate this way, the help and support you receive is fierce and powerful.  If you don't, the help you receive may be unmotivated, uninterested, and sometimes tired.

Again, being a self-starter is *your currency* for begin able to call-in enthusiastic support from your team.
<br />

### Autonomy and Professional Growth

Once I set a clear expectation or outcome, I'll step back and let you do your job. This autonomy empowers you to develop your expertise and confidence. The deeper understanding of our systemsâ€”the *WHY* and *HOW*â€”is best gained through experience, persistence, and self-directed learning.  Going straight to "***help***!!" teaches us nothing. <br />

### Taking Initiative for Your Own Training

While I'm not responsible for always identifying the external training you might need, I *fully support* your professional development! If you discover a compelling training opportunity from a certified third party that relates to our work or where you can improve, bring it to my attention. I'm always open to considering valuable resources that can enhance our team's capabilities.  That said, it's also not my job to set up educational curriculum, either: **I need you to honestly assess your own blind-spots and identify technology areas you yourself are interested in learning**.  Do that, and I will fight every CFO and C-Suite for a training budget. Don't, and...well, I got my own self-learning and training goals to attend to.  Come see me when you find something you're passionate about learning something of value for the team. <br />

## Take-Aways

If this all feels like a "teach a man to fish" talk, it very much *is*.  I also believe in throwing the fisherman right into some waist-high water.  Beginners need to catch a few fish on their own, *before* moving on to big fish and angler tricks.   I do *neither of us* any favors if I am doing "*cross-train theater*", which is just show and tell, before you even *started* fishing (working on the fundamentals)! ðŸ˜‰  But if you're game, and will put in the time it takes for mastery of first-principles of something, some great things can happen. <br />

To foster a team environment where everyone takes initiative, learns proactively, and contributes effectively -- I believe people must leave their confort zones and build confidence.  Team leaders should always lead by example here.  Help enthusiastically, but always ask what has been tried. <br /> 

By focusing on self-reliance and continuous learning, we actually all grow *together* and meet the challenges in our field *head-on*. Embrace this approach, and you can work collaboratively on powerful teams that achieve amazing outcomes and shared success.

**I am rooting for you!**
