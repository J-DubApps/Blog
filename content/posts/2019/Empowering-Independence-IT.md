In a dynamic world of IT Systems Ops and DevOps, effective cross-training is a always challenge. Skill-ups are essential for both individual growth *and* team success. Over many years of experience as a PM, manager, and mentor, I have developed a philosophy that emphasizes ***self-reliance, initiative, and continuous learning***. Found below is my (*imperfect*, but effective) personal manifesto on cross-training. In writing my own contribution to what I believe is key to developing proficient and empowered teams, I have seen what does and doesn't work.  What is below is my still-evolving approach... <br />

<h3>Teaching the <i>WHERE</i> or the <i><u>WHAT</u></i>, </i><u>Not</u></i> Always the WHY or the <u><i>HOW</i></u></h3>

I can provide you with the ***WHERE***â€”the documentation, server information, IP addresses, and other essential resources (in fact, that is what we MUST document ongoing and every day); ***however***, I may not always have the time to delve into the ***WHY*** behind every technology or decision, nor the in-depth ***HOW*** of every process. We are so busy everyday documenting the ***WHAT*** and the ***WHERE*** items I describe above, that it leaves precious *little-to-no* time for writing deep explainatory click-by-click or [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) ***HOW*** steps to complete a task, or get an outcome: that is where *your own skills-growth* must rise to the occasion.  <br /> 

I am talking about [**First Principles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) training on any area of tech you are working with: fundamentals which always cover the *Why* of a thing. **First Principles** are needed before any mentor can really help you in ***the knowing*** of the *How* and *Why* of any technology you are working with and supporting. Getting the nuances of an IT or DevOps system takes time *because* depth-of-understanding come mostly from *hands-on experience*.  Also required is your own personal initiative, and (again) ***time***. While I can guide you to resources briefly cover fundamentals about a technology or tool, uncovering the *why* and *how* is ultimately ***your*** journey: and I cannot make the journey for you.  I can only try to make be helpful for your learning, but I can't make it *easy*.  Make sense? <br /> 

Learning fundamentals of *any* technology is a path of *personal exploration and practice*, sometimes on your own time. Taking your own time to push through learning **First Principles** is how you get *started* at anything in this line of work, and the first steps to getting *good* at anything in tech!  If you put in your time on basics, *same as everybody else*, then you will find the peer-help you want,  is more readily-available to you.  Learning is a flow between ***personal time invested*** *and* collaboration: never one or the other. <br />

But most people want ALL learning to be collaborative, most of the time: I'm sorry, but that will never be the case. The deepest, *best* learning is a combination of personal time and collaboration, and *early* in your journey it's probably 70% personal learning + 30% mentoring. So putting in your time *personally* in learning anything in tech (building your own lab, coding your own Powershell script, or configuring your own network/server gear) is how you *get* the fundamentals of this stuff!  And getting fundamentals nailed is the way to even *know enough* to ask the right questions, to *learn more*!  So [**First Principles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) (and taking the time to learn them) is *everything* when you are trying to get mentored effectively in any technology job!  You, yourself, and learning *First Principles* are the gateway to mastery of anything, always.  <br /> 

And if you don't have that kind of time (and I get it, I truly do) -- you at least owe it to your teammates to train-up to a point where you can at least use system Documentation (the *where* and the *what*) as best you can.  Just understand, if you don't have time for skillset-growth in an area -- no one owes you their time away from their own tasks...to help you fill in *all* the blanks, *all* of the time.

### Setting Clear Expectations and Providing Support

We're all adults and professionals at work, so senior engineers and mentors' job 1 is to trust in your ability to take ownership of challenging tasks, and of your ***fundamental skills-development***. But a good Team Lead, manager, or mentor will *always* set clear expectations for outcomes on new tasks and tech you will work with.  And they should always ensure you have the tools and support you need; ***however***, I expect junior engineers to begin the work ***without*** requiring a lot of immediate step-by-step guidance or hand-holding. This sounds strict or unhelpful, but *understand* -- I want you to bother with *getting stuck first* before needing help!  Needing numerous question asked/answered at the *start* of a task is ***not*** how we do that.  **Dive in *first***!!  Explore and take initiative to solve problems independently, and *then* seek assistance when needed.  This  leads to *better* support from your local [**SME**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-matter_expert) and teammates!  In Enterprise IT and DevOps, your performance is *directly-measured* by outcomes and accountability -- and part of accountability is working *independently* (at least *at first*) toward the outcome or result you are trying for. **Fair or not, being a self-starter is** ***your currency*** **for being able to call-in *enthusiastic* support and assistance from other skilled team members**!

### Embrace Challenges, And Seek Help When You Get Truly Stuck

Some people are uncomfortable *starting* something new, or jumping in cold.  They are afraid they'll look dumb, or unknowledgable.  That's human, but understand: **challenges and discomfort are opportunities for growth**!  So as a mentor I always encourage reports or teammates to tackle obstacles *head-on* and make a genuine opening-effort to overcome them. If you find yourself truly stuck, exhausting resources after you start --  I'm of course there to assist.  But remember what I said above about *currency* -- when you come to to a *good* mentor for help, they will *always* ask what you've already tried first. This approach ensures you're actively engaged in some kind of problem-solving process and were learning. <br />

Remember that independently trying ***first*** is <u>***everything***</u> in troubleshooting and learning: joyfully get *stuck*, do it with zeal!  Because *that* is where the real learning happens in tech jobs, and where ***geeks like myself*** get motivated to enthusiastically help! If you ask for help without having tried much (without *getting stuck* ***first***) we're going to have a chat, and you're probably going to receive this blog post. ðŸ˜‚  <br />

**Pro Tip**: The secret about getting *enthusiastic support* from your local SME or uber nerd is--*trying to solve the problem independently*, and be ok (even excited) to *get stuck first* before firing-off an email thread or asking for help.  If you operate this way, the help and support you receive is fierce and powerful.  If you don't, the help you receive may be unmotivated, uninterested, and sometimes tired.

**tl;dr: Being a self-starter (and putting in the time, first, to even get stuck) is *your currency* for being able to call-in enthusiastic support from your team!**
<br />

### Autonomy and Professional Growth

Once I set a clear expectation or outcome, I'll step back and let you do your job.  No mentor would ever do otherwise, if they care about you learning.  This autonomy empowers you to develop your expertise and confidence. I do you *no favors* if I am doing something for you immediately.  A *deeper understanding* of our systems (the *WHY* and the *HOW*) is best gained through experience, persistence, and self-directed learning.  Going straight to "***help***!!" teaches us nothing. <br />

### Taking Initiative for Your Own Training

While I'm not responsible for always identifying the external training you might need, I *fully support* your professional development! If you discover a compelling training opportunity from a certified third party that relates to our work or where you can improve, bring it to my attention. I'm always open to considering valuable resources that can enhance our team's capabilities.  That said, it's also not my job to set up educational curriculum, either: **I need you to honestly assess your own blind-spots and identify technology areas you yourself are interested in learning**.  Do that, and I will fight every CFO and C-Suite for training budget funds to get you resources. *Don't* and...well, I got my own self-learning and training goals to attend to.  Come see me when you find something you're passionate about learning something of value for the team! <br />

## Take-Aways

If this all felt like a "teach a man to fish" talk, it very much *was*. ðŸ˜‰ I believe in throwing the fisherman right into some waist-high water, to catch a few fish on their own, *before* moving on to big fish and angler tricks.  I do *neither of us* any favors if I am doing "*cross-train theater*": show and tell, click here / type that, before you even *started* learning the fundamentals. ðŸ˜‰  But if you're game, and you put in the time it takes learning first-principles of something, some great things will happen and your teammates and mentors will cheer you on! <br />

To foster a team environment where everyone takes initiative, learns proactively, and contributes effectively -- I believe people must leave their confort zones and build confidence. I do this by specifically *not* documenting deep inanely-detailed *HOW* documentation (which is a symptom of internal skill issues, usually) and having Process Pocumentation be *brief* and augmented by System Documentation.  Team leaders should always lead by example here.  Help *enthusiastically*, but always *always* first ask what has been tried.  If we all aren't continuously learning, we're failing ourselves and our team mission. <br /> 

**Last tl;dr**: by focusing on self-reliance and continuous learning, we actually all grow *together* and meet the challenges in our field *head-on*. Embrace this approach, and you can work collaboratively on powerful teams that achieve amazing outcomes and shared success.
