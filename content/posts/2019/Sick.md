The fever broke yesterday, the day after Christmas, but I still feel like a train hit me. And the <i>cough</i> is insane.  It leaves me feeling like I can't breathe. <br />

I know stress and work can lead to a lowered immune response, but this has been ridiculous and has to be some kind of virus.  On the one hand, it feels like the Flu, but on the other hand there's no nauseau.  It's bizarre, and the clinic here in Las Vegas I went to had me testing negative for flu and strep.  I truly feel like I picked up some kind of virus when I was in Austin, or at DFW airport flying out.  Who knows? <br />

Back on the stress: it was a busy year for me.  Having helped launch an office at the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Manhattan_West">One Manhattan West</a> building, and then on the heels of that a rebuild of virtual infra in Austin...I have been <i>hopping</i> and dodging bullets to nail project timelines.  The NYC project lasted over 8 months, and my company had to essentially light the building for bandwidth, as we were the first active tenant (other than the <a href="https://www.nhl.com">NHL</a> -- who really owes me season Stars tickets, for all the bandwidth our project pulled-in for their floors ðŸ˜‰). <br />

I had a great team, but a lot of these projects and timelines fell on me and my LAN/WAN designs and virtual Compute infra.  I thrive on pressure, but also I knew I had been burning the candle at both ends.  And now this weird illness from out of the blue hit me a week ago when I got to Las Vegas to visit family.   I literally have been in bed for 5 days, wheezing for air with a fever and losing 6 pounds.  I got up only to wave to my nephews and niece for Christmas Day, before collapsing back into bed.<br />

But there's hope because the fever broke yesterday! And my energy is such that I was able to have breakfast with family today, and write this blog post. This is one of the worst illnesses I recall having, right up there with 2002 when I had walking pneumonia.  But feels like I turned a corner.  Which is good, because I have to fly home in a couple days for New Years. <br /> <br />

<i><b>Note from February 2020:</b> I have since been told by my doctor that I very well may have had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">Covid-19</a>. The virus tearing accross the globe right now. In two words, holy sh**.</i> ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜¬
