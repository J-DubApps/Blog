# Skill Gap

You may have heard me use this term a time or two. Let's define it: <br />

**A *skill gap*, or *skills gap*, refers to the discrepancy between abilities you currently possess, and those required to *perform* a task-or fill a company role or position**. By pinpointing the differences between your *existing skill sets* and *additional competencies needed* for various roles, an organization or team can devise training to foster skill development. Furthermore, *recognizing* these gaps (*on our own*) enables us to identify where we need to *learn*, and become equipped with the qualifications necessary to meet an organizationâ€™s demands.

The term "Skill Gap" is ***not*** meant to be critical, and it is certainly should *never* be used to disparage a colleague. It's just soberly observing *facts*, acknowledging that we're all lifelong learners in IT work: the term identifies when you're lacking a specific skillset needed.  And in identifying that skill gap, we work together to figure out how to address the capability you're missing, and get training and [*skill up*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skill_up) for you.  In essence, we work to close the gap between "*what you know*" and "*what you can* ***do***" for the team. **We *all* have skill gaps** at times, of *some kind*, that ***is*** the very the nature of technology knowledge-work!  And what matters most is how we manage those situations and continue growing.  <br />

Taking *responsibility* for a gap in skill, being accountable and responsive to address it, is where we ***all*** want to be as Knowledge-Workers in technology: because that's where *growth* and professional-development will happen!
