# Skill Gap

You may have heard me use this term a time or two. Let's define it: <br />

**A *skill gap*, or *skills gap*, refers to the discrepancy between abilities you currently possess, and those required to perform a task-or fill a company role or position**. By pinpointing the differences between your’ *existing skill sets* and additional *competencies needed* for various roles, an organizations or team can devise training to foster skill development. Furthermore, *recognizing* these gaps (*on our own*) enables us to identify where we need to *learn*, and become equipped with the qualifications necessary to meet an organization’s demands.

The term is ***not*** meant to be criticial, and it is certainly should *never* be used to disparage a colleague. It's just observing facts: you may be lacking a specific skillset you need.  And identifying the skill gap, we work together to figure out how to address the capability you're missing, and get training and [*skill up*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skill_up) for youy.  In essence, we work to close the gap between "*what you know*" and "*what you can* ***do***" for the team. **We *all* have skill gaps** at times, of *some kind*, and what matters most is how we manage those situations and continue growing.  <br />

Taking *responsibility* for a gap in skill, is where we all want to be when we identify a skill gap: because that's where *growth* and professional-development can happen!
