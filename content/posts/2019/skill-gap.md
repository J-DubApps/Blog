#Skill Gap

You may have heard me use this term a time or two. Let's define it: <br />

**A skill gap, or skills gap, refers to the discrepancy between abilities you currently possess, and those required to perform a task or fill a company role or position. By pinpointing the differences between your’ *existing skill sets* and additional *competencies needed* for various roles, an organizations or team can devise training to foster skill development. Furthermore, *recognizing* these gaps (*on our own*) enables us to identify where we need to *learn*, and become equipped with the qualifications necessary to meet an organization’s demands.**

The term is not meant to be criticial, and certainly not an insult.  It's just facts. We *all* have skill gaps.  <br />

Taking responsibility for a gap in skill, is where we all want to be, because that's where growth happens!
