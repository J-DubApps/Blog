This past weekend I passed the <a href="http://www.pmi.org/Certification/Project-Management-Professional-PMP.aspx">Project Management Professional</a> exam to earn the certification awarded by <a href="http://www.pmi.org/default.aspx">PMI</a>. Feels really good to have it done. The PMP is one of the most difficult designations to obtain in my industry, so it was a worthwhile effort and I studied for it on and off for the better part of a year. Project management is a valued skill for systems architects and senior engineers, but to me it was a great way to personally validate my own knowledge that have I developed these past 15 years managing various IT projects.<br />
>
Next itâ€™s on to planning my PDU opportunities to maintain the cert (60 PDUs required every 3 years), and figuring out what my next certification objective should be. CCIE was in the top-running. Or maybe Scrum Master although my Agile projects have been somewhat limited. CCIE requires as much time-investement as the PMP, perhaps even more.<br />

For now, a little rest and celebration is in order!<br />
