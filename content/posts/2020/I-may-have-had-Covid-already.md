Today I had a follow-up appointment with my doctor, who saw me last month after I flew home recovering from <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/sick/">that weird illness I had over Christmas and New Years</a>. He says that I very well may have had this scary new virus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">Covid-19</a> already, right as it's apparently going into Pandemic mode.  Since nobody could figure out what I had, and because it was so severe and lasted as long as it did, I think my doc is probably right.  In Austin in December, I was briefly in contact with people who had been traveling from the area in China where this thing first hit.  And then a few days later I was at the international terminal at DFW Airport.  So who knows? <br />

And other sad anecdotal data points to my having had 'Rona, as well: all of my in-laws and family we visited in Las Vegas got super sick going into the New Year, for several days each. Right as we flew home.  My sister-in-law tested negative for everything testable, and she was even coughing up blood (!!) before finally getting better going into February. <br />

In reading about the symptoms in China and what is appearing in Europe now, it sure does feels like this was what I had 50 days ago.  Scary stuff.
