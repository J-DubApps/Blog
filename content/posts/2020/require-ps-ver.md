PowerShell has a robust scripting environment that allows for quick and flexible code creation. But what happens when a script that relies on PowerShell 7 or specific modules gets executed on PowerShell 5.1? It fails, often with confusing errors.  Enter the <span class="mono">#requires</span> statementâ€”a feature that allows you to preemptively enforce prerequisites for your scripts. <br />

If you remember, we actually talked about it [earlier this month](https://julianwest.me/Blog/require-admin-ps/) on how to use the <span class="mono">#requires -RunAsAdministrator</span> statement to make a script require being executed in an Admin PS session. But <span class="mono">#requires</span> can do a lot more!

The <span class="mono">#requires</span> statement ensures that your script will only execute under the proper conditions, such as the right PowerShell version, required modules, or user privileges. If these prerequisites arenâ€™t met, PowerShell immediately throws an error and stops the scriptâ€”saving you time and unnecessary troubleshooting. <br />

Letâ€™s dive into how to use the <span class="mono">#requires</span> statement effectively. <br />

As we covered a couple weeks ago, the <span class="mono">#requires</span> statement must be placed at the *very top* of your script. It is processed before any other code executes. If the conditions defined in the <span class="mono">#requires</span> line arenâ€™t met, the script bails and halts immediately. <br />

Hereâ€™s a basic example that enforces a PowerShell version: <br />

~~~
#requires -Version 7.0

# rest of script here

~~~

So if someone tries to run this script in PowerShell 5.1, theyâ€™ll see an immediate error like this: <br />

<span class="mono">The script is not supported on this system. PowerShell version 7.0 or greater is required.</span> <br />

<b>Key Options for <span class="mono">#requires</span></b> <br />

The #requires statement has several options that allow you to define exactly what your script needs. Here are the most common:
1.	-Version: Enforces a minimum PowerShell version.
2.	-Modules: Ensures required modules are available.
3.	-RunAsAdministrator: Requires the script to run with elevated privileges (covered [a couple weeksback](https://julianwest.me/Blog/require-admin-ps/))
4.	-PSSnapin (legacy): Ensures a specific snap-in is available (mostly for older scripts). 

Leaving out <span class="mono">#Requires -RunAsAdministrator</span> that we already covered, and the old legacy <span class="mono">-PSSnapin</span>, letâ€™s look at the <span class="mono">#requires -Modules</span> option in more detail: <br />

**Requiring Modules** <br />

Sometimes your script depends on certain modules to function correctly. Instead of manually checking for their existence, use <span class="mono">#requires</span> to enforce them: </br>

~~~
#requires -Modules ActiveDirectory, Az

# rest of script here

~~~

This line ensures the ActiveDirectory and Az modules are available. If theyâ€™re missing, PowerShell stops execution and throws an error. <br />

**Combining Multiple Requirements**

You can combine multiple #requires statements to enforce complex conditions. For example: <br />

~~~
#requires -Version 7.0
#requires -Modules ActiveDirectory
#requires -RunAsAdministrator

# rest of script here

~~~

So this script will *only* execute if:
1.	PowerShell 7.0 (or higher) is running.
2.	The ActiveDirectory module is available.
3.	The user has administrative privileges.

<b>How <span class="mono">#requires</span> Improves Script Resilience</b> <br />

By using <span class="mono">#requires</span>, you avoid runtime errors caused by missing prerequisites. Instead of a cryptic failure halfway through the script, the user gets an immediate and clear error messageâ€”saving both time and frustration. <br />

For example, instead of doing this manually: <br />

~~~
if ($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.Major -lt 7) {
    Write-Error "This script requires PowerShell 7.0 or greater!"
    exit
}

~~~

You can simply write: <br />

~~~
#requires -Version 7.0

~~~

Itâ€™s cleaner, more elegant, and follows best practices. <br />

Best Practices for #requires
1.	<b>Always Place <span class="mono">#requires</span> at the Top</b>: It must be the very first executable line in your script.
2.	<b>Be Specific</b>: Use <span class="mono">-Version</span> and <span class="mono">-Modules</span> to communicate clear requirements.
3.	Combine Requirements: Use multiple <span class="mono">#requires</span> lines if your script has multiple dependencies.
4.	Document Prerequisites: Even with <span class="mono">#requires</span>, include comments explaining why certain conditions are needed.

**Example Script** <br />

Hereâ€™s an example of a script that requires PowerShell 7, the Az module, and administrative privileges: <br />

~~~
#requires -Version 7.0
#requires -Modules Az
#requires -RunAsAdministrator

# Sample Script: Retrieve Azure Resource Groups
Write-Output "Checking Azure Resource Groups..."

# Connect to Azure
Connect-AzAccount

# List Resource Groups
Get-AzResourceGroup | Select-Object ResourceGroupName, Location

~~~

If someone runs this script without PowerShell 7, the Az module, or admin rights, theyâ€™ll get an immediate and clear error. <br />

<b>When <i>Not</i> to Use <span class="mono">#requires</span></b> <br />

While <span class="mono">#requires</span> is extremely helpful, there are a few situations where it might not be appropriate:
1.	**Ad-Hoc One-Liners**: For quick testing or one-off scripts, enforcing prerequisites may be overkill.
2.	**Non-Critical Scripts**: For scripts that wonâ€™t cause harm if prerequisites are missing, manual checks may suffice.
3.	**Legacy Environments**: If youâ€™re working in environments with older PowerShell versions, consider backward compatibility carefully.

### Takeaways...

The <span class="mono">#requires</span> statement is a simple yet powerful way to enforce pre-reqs in your PowerShell scripts. By using it, you can ensure your code runs under the correct conditions, reducing errors and making your scripts more reliable.

Give <span class="mono">#requires</span> a spin in your next script, your future self will thank you! ðŸš€
