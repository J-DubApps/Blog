-In IT or any technical Knowledge Worker arena (Software Engineering, Systems Srchitecture, or technical Product/Program/Project Management),Â learn First Principles of whatever technology you work in and around.  If you learn & know the basic concepts, design patterns, architectures etc...then all that is left is to learn the ***syntactical differences*** and ***workflows*** that make any new upcoming technology or framework unique. <br />

*put another way*... <br />

-"**Learn the fundamentals, then learning new things is easier**." <br />

Tabs are better than spaces.  There, I said it.  Sorry, but itâ€™s just true. ðŸ¤“ <br />

Spaces aren't *horrible*, but if you read the above & lost respect for me -- you're probably a Javascript developer, which makes me pity you *more*. ðŸ¥¸ <br />

If you're a small company and don't have a deep bench to pull from for both IT project work *and* the daily support-grind, don't diss your star IT players. Lest ye end up dependent on consultants and MSPs!  <br />

Your hardest workers on your ServiceDesk or Helpdesk are doing their best in a daily hailstorm of shifting priorities and demands.  Be kind.  <br />
