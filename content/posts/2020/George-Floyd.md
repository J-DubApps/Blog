> "Please, I can’t breathe." — George Floyd

From [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/us/george-floyd.html).

Disturbing and haunting final words.  I have not watched the video this comes from.  I don't need to, to understand the rage erupting right now.  This feels 100x worse than [Fergusson Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest), and it should.
