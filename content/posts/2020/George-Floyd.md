> "Please, I can’t breathe." — George Floyd

From [this article](https://www.npr.org/2020/05/27/862956646/george-floyds-death-stokes-call-for-minneapolis-officers-to-be-charged-with-murd).

Disturbing and haunting final words, and not the first time.  This feels 100x worse than [Fergusson Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest).  And it should.
