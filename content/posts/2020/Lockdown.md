Well <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19">Covid-19</a>'s spread is upon us, already having hit Canada and parts of the US.  Meanwhile <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/sick/">my doctor tells me I probably already had this in December last year</a>. This thing was probably already over here, in certain areas, just not at the level it is now. At this age I *think* I have lived through two pandemics?  But they seemed like tiny bumps in the road, given what CDC and others say is upon us for the next few weeks. <br />

Our IT Team completed a rapid deployment of remove work infrastructure and beefed-up remote access for my company, just as the lockdowns started happening.  I feel like this is going to be longer than a couple weeks, but <i>hopefully</i> this is all over in a month. <br /> <br />


<b><i>Update/Note from July 2020:</b> Welp, that was a poor prediction.  Lockdown continues, millions dead and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/11/coronavirus-update-us/">another surge underway</a>.  And America?  Well, we're doing what we do best during times like this: chaos, anger, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election/confusion-long-lines-at-some-pollsites-as-eight-u-s-states-vote-during-coronavirus-pandemic-idUSKBN2391B5/">frustration on parade</a>.  But I get it.  After <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/george-floyd-protests-global-rallying-cry-democracy">George Floyd</a> and lockdown anger, we're in a very sad and anxious time.</i>
