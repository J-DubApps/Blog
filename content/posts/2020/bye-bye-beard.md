[If you've been tracking my beard progress](https://julianwest.me/Blog/my-hemingway-lockdown/), it has...well, *progressed further*.

But this will be the *final* beard photo of 2020, as I am cutting it back pre-Pandemic size this weekend.  And getting a haircut.  

Maybe I'll grow it back again someday.  It was fun, and a helpful indicator that I made it through a very weird times.
