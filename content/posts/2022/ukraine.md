> "NATO allies are united in their resolve to protect every inch of alliance territory," said NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

After months of "will he or won't he" intrigue, Putin has [launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60506568). <br />

As I am still working to get used to life [without both my parents in it](https://julianwest.me/Blog/joy-pennybacker-west-1930-2022/), I have not really been paying attention to the build-up.  But like my father before me, I am fairly anti Russian.  And Russia hasn't given me much reason to like about them since they stopped being Soviet Union. In name only, apparently. <br />

I feels very surreal, because this is probably going to already be Europeâ€™s most significant military conflict since World War II. <br /> 

Also surreal, because just a three years ago our last President was [Impeached](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump) over matters pertaining partially to Ukraine.  <br /> 

Strange times.  I wish the Ukraine people every possible success and hope for peace.
