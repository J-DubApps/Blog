“***Gala of Groupthink***” is my shorthand for a grand-sounding initiative that dresses up mediocrity in dazzling presentations—until everyone realizes they’re celebrating a collective delusion. <br />

I come up with sardonic turns-of-phrase like that, every so often. This was one I used today when it became clear that several folks on a project were kind of falling into repeated groupthink moments on a project deliverable over the past few weeks. -- <br />

Stay-tuned for more silly ***JDub-isms*** in the future...
