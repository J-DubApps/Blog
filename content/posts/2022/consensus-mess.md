“***Consensus Catastrophe***” is my shorthand for when every stakeholder signs off on something inherently flawed, simply because unanimous agreement feels safer than honest disagreement. <br />

I come up with turns-of-phrase like that, every so often. This was one I used today when I could see that a VIP's pet project was not going to get re-scoped or adjusted for a risk I could spot a mile-away. I'll talk to them about it, of course, but I was kind of amazed to see how everybody just "*went with it*"! 🙃 -- <br />

Stay-tuned for more silly ***JDub-isms*** in the future...
