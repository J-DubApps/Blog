[Saw this on NPR today](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-dobbs-decision), and it felt like the moment the Roberts court agreed to take-up *Dobbs v. Jackson Womenâ€™s Health Organization*, Roe's days were numbered as law. <br />  

It was just matter of formality and time after Barrett's appointment.  <br /> 

This blog is intentionally *apolitical*, by design, but I have to observe a major event in US Law like this. An event that will affect women for decades.
