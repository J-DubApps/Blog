[Coverage on today's news from NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/24/1102305878/supreme-court-abortion-roe-v-wade-decision-overturn) that Roe is no longer law. <br />

It felt like the moment the Roberts court agreed to take-up *Dobbs v. Jackson Womenâ€™s Health Organization*, Roe's days were numbered as law. At least, it was only a matter of time after Barrett's appointment. <br />  

This blog is intentionally *apolitical*, by design, but I have to observe a major event in US Law like this. An event that will affect women for decades.
