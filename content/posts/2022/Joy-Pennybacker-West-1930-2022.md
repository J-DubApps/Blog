My mother Joy Pennybacker West passed from this world earlier this evening.  I was with her as she gently passed, and we were listening to her favorite music.<br />

She was a great mom to me, and a light in the world for those who knew her.  I am unable to find the words right now.  I just want to thank my mom, for everything she gave me in life. <br />

We are still planning her memorial which I will post here when I know more.
