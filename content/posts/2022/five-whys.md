## What Are the "5 Whys"?

The "**5 Whys**" is a straightforward but powerful problem-solving strategy. It seeks to uncover the true source of a problem by repeatedly asking “***why***”—**usually *five* times**—until you reach the fundamental cause. <br />

In practice, you begin by asking “**why**” the problem occurred. Each time you find a new explanation, you ask “***why***” *again*. This process continues until you’re confident you’ve revealed the underlying reason behind the issue.  If this technique sounds a little familiar, you've probably seen it before as a part of the [Scientific Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method). The "*5 Whys*" isn't *that exhaustive* or time-consuming, but is a very popular quick troubleshooting technique.  <br />

## Why Use the 5 Whys?

By going beyond surface-level symptoms, the 5 Whys helps you identify the real root cause. Once you focus on what truly triggered the issue, you can devise a more effective and lasting solution—one that reduces the risk of the problem returning. <br />

### Origins of the 5 Whys

This technique is often linked to [Sakichi Toyoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakichi_Toyoda), the founder of [Toyota Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Industries). It became a key part of the Toyota Production System (TPS), widely known for its commitment to continuous improvement. Although rooted in manufacturing, the 5 Whys has proven valuable in many different fields. <br />

## Example of the 5 Whys In Action

**Problem**: <br />

> ``` The production line stopped working. ```

**Why Questions**:  <br />

***Why*** **did the production line stop**?

> ``` Because the machine was overheated. ```

***Why*** did the machine overheat?

> ```Because the cooling system failed. ```

***Why*** did the cooling system fail?

> ``` Because the pump stopped working. ```

***Why*** did the pump stop working?

> ```Because it wasn’t maintained regularly. ```

***Why*** wasn’t the pump maintained regularly?

> ``` Because there wasn’t a scheduled maintenance plan in place.  ```

In this example, asking "***Why***" several times allows the team to identify root cause-of the production line stopping.  The lack of a maintenance plan being identified, and addressed as root cause, allows this particular issue with the production line to be prevented, in the future. <br />

### Benefits of the 5 Whys

1.	**Identifies Root Causes** <br />
By persisting with “why,” you can move past superficial fixes and locate the core factors driving the problem. <br />
2.	**Encourages Critical Thinking** <br />
The repetitive questioning challenges assumptions and compels teams to think more deeply about interrelated factors. <br />
3.	**Simple and Cost-Effective** <br />
The 5 Whys doesn’t require specialized tools or extensive training. It’s an easy-to-implement method suitable for organizations of any size. <br />

Keep in mind that “***five***” is not set in stone—sometimes you’ll reach the root cause in *fewer* steps, or sometimes you may need more. The goal is simply to continue asking “***why***” until you’re confident you’ve arrived at a clear *root cause* and *actionable solution*.
