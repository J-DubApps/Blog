So Blueberry, our <a img="https://www.tesla.com/modelx">Tesla Model X</a>, came with Tesla's "HW2.5" Full-Self-Driving computer and sensor suite <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/hello-blueberry/">when we bought it last year.</a><br />

And earlier this year <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/01/25/teslaf-patents-ai-chip-autopilot-hardware-3-0/">HW3 was leaked, then announced</a>, just a few mere months after I bought our car and paid in-full for <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot">FSD</a>. ARGH! <br />

Turns out that Tesla will indeed honor those FSD buyers <a href="<https://electrek.co/2019/03/29/tesla-full-self-driving-computer-retrofit-elon-musk/">with a HW3 retrofit</a> later this year or next year.</a> <br />

I'll take it.  Thanks for doing right by your customers, Tesla.
