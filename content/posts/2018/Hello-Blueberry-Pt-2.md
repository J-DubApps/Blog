It is bittersweet since <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/a-letter-to-our-dog/a-letter-to-our-dog/">we lost little Jackson last month</a>, but life must go on and I got the call that our Tesla Model X had arrived.  To be honest I had completely forgot.<br />

So we went down to the Tesla Service Center on Cedar Springs in Dallas and picked Blueberry up.

It isn't a bad little crossover SUV.  It can seat 7 humans (with the rear folding seats option) and make 0-60 in 3.9 seconds.
