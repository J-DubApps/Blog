Well I just remembered (read: *mourned*) that one of my absolute favorite TV shows, [FX's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel)) "[*The Americans*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans)" ended its six-season run earlier this year.  And that reminded me that I am no longer under any kind of lid to talk about it, so here's a quick word on my *tiny*, humble, but *fun* contribution to Season 6!  <br />

First, a little background if you are unfamiliar with "*The Americans*" TV series. It is a [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War) spy-drama set in the late 1970s through the 80s, in which two Soviet [KGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB) Intel Officers pose as an American married couple living in a Virginia suburb outside Washington DC. The couple are raising their two American-born kids, and they balance their family life with their spying duties (which get pretty intense, dark, and downright *insane*). <br />

So the husband KGB spy, [Phillip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Jennings_(The_Americans)), has been attending [**EST**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training) courses since Season 3.  Phillip had been experiencing doubt from the terrible things he's been doing while undercover in America, juxtaposed to his wife Elizabeth (who is a partisan Soviet killer spy with terrifying and deadly zeal).  This leads him to explore one of the most "*American* institutions" of the mid-to-late 1970s: [human potential movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Potential_Movement), specifically ***EST***.  <br />

So that's the show in a very incomplete *nutshell* and, if you haven't seen it, *you really should watch it*. It's so good (***really good*** IMHO), well-written, and it pulls you in. Now, *read-on* for the tea on how I made my very minor contribution to Season 6... ‚ò∫Ô∏è <br />

As the show moves through Seasons 4 and 5, and further into the 1980s, they needed to "*keep up*" with where **EST** would be (for accuracy in those scenes).  **EST** became "**The Forum**" (and later "**The Landmark Forum**") in 1985, so by Season 6 the writers and PAs apparently began researching and putting out calls for input about the *post-EST* ***Forum***... <br />  

And that's where [***my old write-up***](https://julianwest.me/Blog/a-funny-thing-happened-after-the-forum-part-1/) (revisiting my attendance of [**The Landmark Forum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide#Landmark_Forum)) resulted in one of the show's Production Assistants and writers contactin me in 2017.  He reached out for a brief Q&A on my 1994 **Landmark Forum** experience, and over a few emails and a brief Q&A in a phone call I could get a sense that Season 6 would be getting away from **EST** and more into **The Forum**.  While hecouldn't say what content, if any, of my discussion or write-up might make it into the show, when I watched the final season I saw two specific scenes that aligned with what we spoke about. To say I was mildly "*giddy*" about that, and the prospect I might have contributed some tiny bit for those scenes, is an understatement. <br />

Apparently my blog SEO was decent enough, where googling "Landmark Forum" and "EST" together yielded a high enough-ranking hit sending traffic to my write-up. The contact from someone working on "*The Americans*" series was wild. And quite interesting! <br />

Anyway, my involvement with "*The Americans'*" final season was *minor* to say the least, basically tertiary.  But the PA *did* write down my mailing address and send me a little bit of swag from the show!  As a fan already of the series, that was super nice of them.  And I remain a tiny bit *proud* that [my old write-up](https://julianwest.me/Blog/a-funny-thing-happened-after-the-forum-part-1/) was interesting enough (and my site SEO good enough) to get that kind of interest and request, in the first place. It still gets the lion's share of feedback, over my other blog posts.  Same with total traffic hits.  <br /> 

So it's fun to think that my write-up perhaps led to some of what we saw depicted in the brief **Landmark** scenes in the Season 6!  I also have to think the PA I spoke with (and perhaps even producers) went to [Landmark Worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmark_Worldwide#Landmark_Forum) as well, and I'd be surprised if at some of the writers and producers weren't **Landmark Forum** Graduates themselves. <br />  

So that's my bit of tea I had to spill, about how my **Landmark Forum** write-up led to some interesting contact from FX a year and a half ago!  And, now that "*The Americans*" is over, I'm left wishing they kept going longer.  But all good things must come to an end.  I like to think Phillip and Elizabeth are back in modern post-soviet Russia, and their two kids are still over here all grown-up and now spying for [Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin) and his Oligarch government.<br />

Now wait...*that* would make a topical revival plot, to bring back *The Americans*!!  ü§î ‚ò∫Ô∏è <br />
