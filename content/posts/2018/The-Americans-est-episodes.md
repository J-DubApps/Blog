After [**my recent post**](https://julianwest.me/Blog/the-americans-and-landmark/) about the FX series “[***The Americans***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Americans),” where a PA and writer reached-out to discuss [**my Landmark Forum posts**](https://julianwest.me/Blog/a-funny-thing-happened-after-the-forum-part-1/), I have heard from people asking which episodes of “***The Americans***” features [**Erhard Seminars Training**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training) (est) scenes. So I compiled a list for them.  <br />

Est plays a notable role in the character development of *Philip Jennings*, who actually uses [Werner Erhard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Erhard) self-improvement seminars to (ironically) experience Authenticity and try to become centered-while *at the same time* being a specialized killer spy who practices deep *inauthenticity*: something that would probably have given Werner Erhard a breakdown.  It was wild to imagine people in service of the Soviet KGB taking American self-improvement seminars while under deep cover. An interesting juxtaposition, and a credit to the writers for adding that est / Landmark angle. <br /> 

So here is my list of “***The Americans***” episodes featuring est or The Forum.  There aren't actually *that many* episodes, as est and The Forum are little side-bits which add color to each season's story arc.  

### 1. Season 2, Episode 8: “New Car”
•	This episode is the first time est is ever mentioned, almost in-passing, but I am including it anyway.  Sandra reminds Stan about her est graduation.  <br />

### 2. Season 3, Episode 1: “EST Men”
•	This episode introduces the est storyline, where Philip and Stan Beeman attend a weekend est seminar. Stan finds the experience unappealing, while Philip (who really only went to keep tabs on Stan, or maybe be his buddy - who knows?) ends up starting to explore its concepts.  <br />

### 3. Season 3, Episode 4: “Dimebag”
•	This episode continnues the est storyline, where Philip and Stan Beeman attend another weekend est seminar. Stan gets called-on to share.  It doesn't go well and Stan says est is all "bullsh*t", and he gets applause for it.  On an unrelated note, Philip really pulls a perfect 80s "David Koresh" look (or maybe Mitch Hedberg) as a disguise for one of his ongoing Ops.   <br />

### 4. Season 4, Episode 1: “Glanders”
•	Phillip is in an est (or Landmark Forum, it's unclear) seminar, going through an exercise on how he felt guilty or *at effect* of how he handled a situation with kid bully (in Soviet Russia, but Phillip leaves that out).  It's a brief scene, but reminds the audience Phillip is continuing to attend est (with Stan Beeman's wife, no less).  <br />

### 5. Season 4, Episode 8: “The Magic of David Copperfield V: The Statue of Liberty Disappears”
•	Elizabeth Jennings attends an est session, reflecting the program’s influence on the characters’ introspection and personal conflicts.  They later talk about est and have a fight when Elizabeth calls "*getting it*" bullsh*t.  Their fight isn't really about est so much as it is about their lives as spies, and the toll it's taking.   <br />

### 6. Season 4, Episode 13: “Persona Non Grata”
•	Philip participates in an est meeting, where he expresses his dissatisfaction with his covert life, highlighting his internal struggles.  This may be the last-appearance of est in the series, as we're heading into the mid-80s now and any future seminar apperances will not show any "est" branding.  <br />

### 7. Season 5, Episode 5: “Lotus 1-2-3"
•	Philip attends a Forum seminar session about how Story affects how we experience (or don't experience) love.  Philiip seems to be thinking about his Russian son.   <br />

### 8. Season 5, Episode 10: “Darkroom"
•	A montage scene with Philip jogging is juxtaposed to a recent Landmark Forum meeting he attended (by this time, the "est" aspects seem to be gone -- and the overall look is that of "*The Forum*" which would about match the time period of Season 5).   <br />

### 9. Season 6, Episode 6: "Rififi"
•	Philip asks Elizabeth about a sudden urgent mission she's taking, and when he tries to ask her what's going on -- and they should talk, and not let things "fester".  Elizabeth responds with "Why don't you take your Forum bullsh*t** and shove it up your ass". The first *official* acknowledgement we're in the mid-80s "*The Forum*", and further confirmation Elizabeth just doesn't share Philip's est / Forum learnings.  Elizabeth later asks Philip for help, without trying to ask, and he heads out to save her mission.  As far as I know this is the last appearance or mention of **The Forum**. <br /> 

As a side note this episode (a two-parter) triggers is a MAJOR plot arc going into episode 7, where Stan Beeman's suspicions of Philip and Elizabeth finally accelerate to a fever-pitch.  Stan confronts Philip to ask "*what's going on*", and Stan sees through Philip's obvious story.  He begins focusing on the Jennings family, working Henry for information and data points, without Henry realizing it.  So episodes 6 & 7 set Stan on a sad collision-course with Philip and Elizabeth in the finale, just 3 episodes later. <br />

**All-in-all, I can't emphasize how *great* this show was**.  It didn't need *any* of the **est** or **Forum** material to be as amazing as it was, it just added interesting color. Well-worth binging all 6 seasons, IMHO.  And ignore people who say Season 5 is a quiet boring season -- it's got *a lot* of cool stuff, too.   One of the best series I ever watched, self-help siliness, or no. <br /> <br />
