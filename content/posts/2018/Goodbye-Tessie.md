After 3 fun years with my <a href="http://julianwest.me/Blog/posts/dangerhighvoltage/">Tesla Model S</a> we are saying goodbye.  That was always the plan, as we own 3 cars and the Model X was a big lift for our little household. <br />

Enjoy this fun little send-off I threw together using my drone & Final Cut Pro last month... with thanks to ["They Might Be Giants"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Might_Be_Giants)
