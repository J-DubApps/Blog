I have shared this [Harvard Business Review article](https://hbr.org/2014/03/hire-slow-fire-fast) far and wide, for years: in my opinion hiring slow, and firing fast is the MOST IMPACTFUL *team-building* activity you can undertake, when needing to establish a cohesive team in any startup or high-performing group.  <br /> 

And in the interest of equal-time, [here is a counterpoint](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hire-slow-fire-fast-lazy-leadership-tom-deierlein/) to the above, which I enjoyed reading even though I didn't 100% agree (never just go for the confirmation bias, y'know!).
