The “***80/20 rule***” refers to the idea that around 80% of results come from *just* 20% of contributing factors. It was coined by [Vilfredo Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto) and is originally known as the ***Pareto principle***. People usually remember the numbers more than the principle’s name. <br />

Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto originally noticed that 80% of Italy’s land was owned by 20% of its people. Over time, this pattern has shown up in many areas, including business, economics, and personal productivity. <br />

Essentially, the 80/20 rule highlights how a small share of causes often produces a large share of outcomes. It’s a useful concept in both business and personal growth because it encourages focusing energy on the factors that make the *biggest impact*. <br />

**Software example**: <br /> 

> "In software engineering, it’s common to discover 20% of features are actually used by 80% of users."

Such an understanding allows dev teams to prioritize the maintenance and support of thoe critical features. <br />

**Productivity example**: <br />

> "Focusing on the most important 20% of tasks can yield 80% of the desired results."

This can help you prioritize your personal tasks, a resource's workload, or even deliverables on a project.

### The Overall Benefit of The 80/20 Rule

The Pareto principle offers a useful perspective on how a *relatively small set of factors* can produce a *disproportionately large* share of outcomes. <br />

By pinpointing and prioritizing the most influential 20% that generates 80% of the results, both individuals and organizations can streamline their efforts, boost efficiency, and pave the way for greater success. <br />

Still, it’s crucial to remember that the 80/20 split is ***a guideline*** more than it is any kind of ***precise rule*** or predictable methodology. <br />

The actual figures often shift depending on the situation, so it’s important to regularly reassess and adapt strategies as circumstances evolve.  But often the pattern of this principle appears in many things, and recognizing when it's occuring gives us a powerful tool.
