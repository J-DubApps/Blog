**Special Preface Note**: This post is about self-improvement and *building confidence* when making tough calls...*or not* making them. It's about approaching "***Decision vs Choice***" from a *place of empowerment*: a **mental framework** for *another way to view* ***decisions*** from a different angle—as a *different thing* entirely from ***choices***.  It's a *Philosophical distinction* of the two words, putting-aside their *definitions* for a moment—as these two words often mean the "*same thing*" to most people. This write-up, *below*, is not for *everyone*—it's not a "one size fits all" thing—just my own little breakthrough I figured out years ago, when faced with making tough calls.  *Also please note*: if you are undergoing treatment for [OCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive–compulsive_disorder) maybe skip this, because I feel like the concepts in this framework might be a little stressful if you're managing OCD.  But no worries if you want to read on anyway! <br />

I recently witnessed a friend hitting an indecisive moment, about something fairly mundane: trying to pick what to cook for friends during a spontaneous gathering, and if there was time for a grocery store run...what pairs well with a cabernet...etc.  It was a pretty ordinary moment all of us go through, when entertaining guests; however, in my friend's case he kept second-guessing himself and adding new options/ideas for what *might be good* for dinner. And just *as quickly* he would dismiss a meal idea. He would find x or y reasons why a meal option might *not work*-and it was back to discussing options for dinner. This wavering, about what to cook, went on for several minutes-and became THE topic of discussion for nearly half an hour-with everybody making suggestions to ease our friend's amusing moment of *indecision*.<br />

Now if you know *me*, then you *know* that I have a hard time seeing indecision—*especially* if it's for something not-too-important...yet takes up time and energy. My friend [*vascillated*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vacillate) between so many options—each option with its own *datapoint*—that I felt compelled to ask if they're ok. I mean, we *all* have our moments of indecision, it's ***ok*** and very human; however, his moment ***indecisiveness*** seemed to be one of many during our visit.  This kind of thing may be nothing, but sometimes it also signals a deeper issue with anxiety or self doubt—both things we don't like seeing close friends go through. So after everything got settled, I pulled my friend aside and walked him through an exercise that a mentor once taught me: on distinguishing ***deciding*** from ***choosing*** during moments of indecision. And I am going to try and distill *the concepts* from that exercise here *in this post*.<br /> <br />

## The *Power* of Choice vs. The *Purpose* of Decision

We often can sell ourselves short from from new opportunities or seeing some *other* possibilities, *simply because* we are worried about making the “***wrong decision***”.  We’ve all been there—torn between multiple paths, searching for ***reasons*** or ***justifications*** to confirm we’ve made the *smartest move*. <br /> 

**But what if we *shifted* our perspective, here**?  What if there is a meaningful ***distinction*** to be made *between* ***making a decision***...and ***exercising a choice***?  And what if I told you that **recognizing that difference can give us new avenues of freedom and confidence**? <br />

Sound interesting? To get rolling, we *first* need to define *these terms* (*decision* & *choice*), so that we can make this powerful ***distinction***: a distinction *between* ***deciding*** and ***choosing***—let's go!

## Defining “*Decision*”

***Decide*** is one of those " &#42;***cide*** " words which aren't always rooted in *creation*: sui*cide*, insecti*cide*, or geno*cide* are but three negative words shared with "***decide***"-and for good reason: the Latin root for "***cide***" is ***caedere***, which means "**to cut**" or "***to kill***."  The root "*cide*" carries significant weight, for serious situations, deliberate acts, and justifications.  *Stay with me* on this, it gets *interesting*... <br />

When we "***decide***", or make a "***decision***": we are applying *reason* to ***eliminate alternatives***, effectively "*killing* off" each alternative...until a *single* thing is left...and *that* becomes ***the decision***.  Often we call this arriving at the ***best decision***, or "***the right decision***". <br />

When making a [***decision***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making), it usually involves a set of rational options typically rooted in analysis or reasoning: you consider everything, weigh pros and cons, gather data—you might even consult with friends and experts. *Then you pick* the path that appears *most rational*, reasonable, or has the least risk. **In many ways, *decisions* are about** ***protection***: <br />

•	**Decisions protect us from perceived risk by ensuring we follow a logical process**. <br />
•	**Decisions protect us from *blame*, because we have a line of reasoning that justifies *why* we did what we did**. <br />

***Decisions*** are often crucial—picking which flight to book, choosing how to invest your money, or planning a project budget. The ability to think carefully and logically is vital for problem-solving, especially when the stakes are high.  ***But this protective function can sometimes backfire*** **if we become paralyzed by fear of** “***What if I decide wrong***?” <br /> 

When we *overemphasize* the process of deciding, we might lose sight of possibility or creativity. We focus on *justifying* to ourselves, to others, or to our own self-critical mind, forgetting that *not every situation* demands an exhaustive explanation. Enter ***Decision's*** *Backup-Pilot*: ***Choice***.

## Leveraging “Choice”

So we just defined what a ***decision*** is.  A ***choice***, on the other hand, *simply* ***is***. It doesn’t always come with a mental checklist or a bullet-point rationale. Instead of an exercise in logic, a ***choosing*** can be an act of *creation*—giving life to something new, opening doors you hadn’t previously considered. <br />

**Think about *how* the word** "***choice***" **exists in our language, compared to** "***decisions***": <br />

**Choice** ***expands***, where **decisions** ***limit***. <br />

**Choice** ***creates***, where **decisions** ***protect***. <br />

**Choice** is ***brave***, where **decisions** may be ***fearful***. <br />

A **decision** can always be ***explained***, a *true* **choice** simply ***exists***. <br />

When making a [***choice***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice), the "*decision*" arises from a *different place*. By setting aside my experience, internal debate, and personal biases, I gain the freedom to **truly** ***choose***.  <br />

In ***choosing***, I become open and vulnerable to a ***new possibility***, or a new way of seeing the world, or gaining new experience. ***Choice*** is about something unknown, something creative, and may sometimes even involve a little *risk* and *reward* (entrepreneurs and CEOs, or example, are naturals at pivoting between *decision* and *choice*). <br />

***Choosing*** can often be about **making a** ***choice*** **purely for the** ***sake of choosing***: **not** applying reason, **not** applying logic, **not** removing or disqualifying the **other** ***choices***. <br /> 

Here are a few ways to recognize a “choice” moment:
1.	**Spontaneity & Freedom** – You aren’t required to lay out all the reasons; you’re simply free to act.
2.	**Possibility & Creativity** – Choosing can be about generating something fresh—a new direction, a new mindset, or a new approach to a challenge.
3.	**No Justification Needed** – While it’s perfectly fine to have reasons, a choice doesn’t need them. Sometimes you just feel moved to go in a certain direction.

When you ***choose***, you tap into your power to create. You aren’t bound by having to “*get it right*” through a rational formula. You step *into* a moment of true ownership: “This is what I’m doing, because ***I choose to***.”

# *When* to *Decide* and *When* to *Choose*?

Both ***decisions*** and ***choices*** have *value* and their place in different situations. The ***trick*** is to discern *which* suits the moment.  Here's are scenarios where one makes sense over the other: <br />
1.	**High-Stakes, Technical, or Complex Situations** – Here, a decision process with clear pros, cons, data, and justifications makes sense. You likely want to protect resources (time, money, safety), so carefully *thinking it through* is wise. <br />
2.	**Everyday Moments or Creative Exploration** – When brainstorming new ideas, exploring career possibilities, or just simply deciding how to spend your leisure time-sometimes a *pure choice* is more ***liberating***. You don’t *need* bulletproof logic or justifications to "*decide*" you want cook tacos for dinner...or learn the piano...or try your hand at painting. <br />

Learning that you even ***can choose***...or that you can even ***choose to decide*** is a *powerful ability* seen in history's most successful entrepreneurs, executives, and history's most notable people all figured out.  <br />

Learning to move fluidly between ***decision-making*** *and* ***choosing*** helps you cut through hesitation ***and*** **build confidence** at the same time. Ask yourself, “*Is this a situation where I need to protect something, or is this a situation where I want to create something*?” A decision helps guard established norms or resources; a choice can spark a new creation or possibility. <br />

# Overcoming the Fear of “*Being Wrong*”

Often, the dread of making an *incorrect* ***decision*** comes from thinking every step we take *must be* ***rationally validated***. **That’s a lot of pressure**! If you are in a place where you want to spark a *fresh idea* or *break free* from stagnation, ***let yourself choose*** without *over-explaining* or feeling you *owe a justification* to anybody-even to yourself. <br />

**A few practical tips to move into this powerful mindset**: <br />
1.	**Practice “Small Choices”** – Begin with tiny, low-consequence ***choices***. Skip the mental acrobatics and ***just pick*** *something*—*anything*: maybe it’s which new coffee flavor to try, or which neighborhood to explore on a weekend. These little acts of unencumbered ***choice*** **build your tolerance for the unknown**. <br />
2.	**Let Go of Over-Explaining** – Notice when you start defending yourself unnecessarily. It’s often a sign you’re anxious about how others may judge you, or a sign you're not feeling confident about the decision.  **Recognize that *you have the right* to choose what aligns *for you*—no lengthy explanations required**!! <br />
3.	**Trust Your Inner Compass** – If you’ve already done your due diligence in those *decision-heavy* areas of your life (school, career, a home), then **give yourself permission** to *trust your instincts* elsewhere! Let your curiosity lead, focusing on ***what you might create*** *instead of* fixating on possible pitfalls.

## When A Choice *Morphs Into* A Decision

It is tempting to still ***give reasons*** when *making a* ***choice***–but *strictly-speaking*: adding a lot of considerations and reasons turns your ***choice*** ---> *into* a ***decision***.  That's totally ***OK*** and may be necessary—but it's key to know when you're moving into the ***decision*** realm, so ask: "am I doing something creative or low-stakes?"—if not, then switching to a ***decision*** makes sense. But sometmies we "*slip into*" ***decision-mode*** without knowing it, and that might go *against* what ***choosing is all about***.  Your mileage may vary, and sometimes we *should* examine a ***choice*** we're making-aer we keeping it ***a choice*** or does it need to really be a ***decision***?  <br />

**Ultimately at the bottom of *every*** ***decision*** **is *either* fundamental** ***choice*** ***or*** **fundamental** ***reason***: "*I choose to believe* ..." or "*I choose to trust* ..."–but *adding* "***because***" immediately ***makes it a reason***, and techically *could* transform your ***choice*** into a ***decision***. Because you're using ***reason*** in your ***choice***. And the *spirit* of ***truly choosing*** (compared to ***deciding***) asks you to be spontaneous and ***less reasonable*** in low-stakes or creative situations.  So if you're adding very many **reasons** into your "***choice***", **you're kind of absolving yourself from the responsibility of** ***owning your choice***.  *Not always*, but its hard to say you exercised ***choice*** if you applied a lot of *external* reasons, analysis, or factors.  <br />

**And this is why *truly learning* to embrace *choice* is *SCARY* for some people: **choice demands responsibility for**... ***making the choice***! *Owning it*! 😉 **But *that's* also why true exercising real honest-to-goodness *choice* is a such *HUGE* *confidence-booster***!!** When you ***CHOOSE*** you are declaring that you don't need to justify *making-the-call* to anyone else. <br />

**It's hard to explain this concept *in writing***, but ***trust me***—when we can distinguish ***deciding*** *from* ***choosing*** in our minds *on-the-fly*—intentionally exercising ***choice*** allows us to become ***more decisive*** and *way* ***more confident***.

## The Confidence Connection

**Confidence *grows* when we realize that life isn’t solely about always “*getting it right*” *all* the time**; it’s *also* about ***experiencing***, ***learning***, and ***generating*** new possibilities for ourselves. A ***powerful shift*** happens when we can see that *not every move* requires exhaustive justification. *Some* moments call for a ***decision*** based on reason, while *other* moments unfold best when we simply ***choose*** and see where it leads! <br />

Being confident means respecting *both* dimensions—knowing you are capable of solid [***decision-making***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) when you need it, but also *free to* [***choose***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice) without fear of condemnation or second-guessing. **By embracing this *distinction*, you reclaim your agency and move through life with a deep sense of possibility**.

## A Word About "Snap-Judgements"

There is a realm of decision I didn't touch on and ***cannot*** leave out: "***snap-judgements***"—which we face many times in our lives.  ***Snap-Judgements*** are very-much a hybrid *blend* of ***deciding*** and ***choosing***—and what they *usually* have *in common* is **there is not enough *time*** to really *reason-through* all the options, before *making the call*.  In a ***Snap-Judgement*** situation, people experienced in the above ***distinction***—of seeing ***decision*** and ***choice*** as different things—tend to be *more able* to make those ***snap-decisions***. Why?  Because someone who is practiced at ***choosing*** without a lot of *reasoning* tends to be more comfortable and *confident* at listening to their *intuition* (aka "going with your *gut*").  

And **never forget**: when you are faced with a *difficult* ***Snap-Judgement*** where stakes are high and *time is limited*: such hard **decisions** are only ***hard*** because there are ***no best options***!  And when no options are *good*, and *time is limited*: ***that's* when you have the *power* to exercise *choice***.

# Wrapping Up - *The Takeaway*

When you feel yourself teetering on the edge of a big question—hesitant, anxious, worried about “*the right answer*”—take a moment to ask: "***Is this a moment to decide… or a moment to choose***?" If you’re protecting your resources or ensuring critical objectives are met, making a structured ***decision*** is the way. But if you’re seeking to *create* something *fresh* or ***free yourself*** **from perfectionism**, lean hard into ***choice***. <br />

**A decision explains and *protects*; a choice *creates* and simply *exists***. <br />

***Give up*** the constant need to *justify*: that's the *first step* into a world where you can safeguard what needs protecting (***deciding***), but ***also*** be creative or free when you want (***choosing***). ***Give up*** *always* having to "*get it right*" on low-stakes everyday things.  Learning to make a ***distinction*** *between* ***decision*** vs ***choice*** (and then ***exercising choice***, when appropriate) can take some effort—but eventually it comes naturally and fosters greater confidence.  Confidence dissolves the fear of “*being wrong*,” allowing you to live, learn, and create: one ***choice*** at-a-time! <br />

## Now get out there and make good *choices* (...or *decisions*)!!
