When making a [***decision***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making), usually involving a set of rational options.

When making a [***choice***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice), the decision arises from a different place. By setting aside my experience, internal debate, and personal biases, I gain the freedom to ***choose***.


*Deciding* is related to other "*cide" words (suicide, insecticide, genocide), and is the result of applying reason to eliminate alternatives, effectively killing them. Usually a single thing is left and that becomes the decision. Choosing is about making a choice purely for the sake of choosing, not applying reason, not applying logic, not removing or disqualifying the other choices. I have purposefully not quoted the Landmark definition of decision and choice as that is copywrited material by them. Everyone likes to use reason, but ultimately, at the bottom of every decision or even proofs, is either fundamental choice or reason: "I choose to believe ..." or "I choose to trust ..." adding "because" makes it a reason. By using reason, one then absolves oneself from responsibility for the choice, it becomes the fault of the reason or the reasoning process if it fails. Choice demands responsibility for making the choice.

I open myself to new possibilities, new ways of seeing the world, or new experiences. Choice involves embracing the unknown, inviting creativity, and taking risk.

Choice is *brave* where decisions are *fearful*.

Choice *expands*, where decisions *limit*.

Choice *creates*, where decisions *protect*.


You can choose...or you can *choose* to *decide*.


I become open and vulnerable to a *new possibility*, a new way of seeing the world, or a new experience.   Choice is about something unknown, something creative, and may involve some risk and reward.  


> More is lost by indecision than wrong decision. Indecision is the thief of opportunity. It will steal you blind.” — Cicero

A decision can be explained, a choice simply *exists*.

By having participants pick ice cream multiple time this exercise highlights just how instinctively we try to justify ourselves.

It also demonstrates the surprising power and freedom of simply declaring “I choose,” no explanation required.

That small but profound distinction can open up new personal insights and help people experience a real breakthrough in how they approach decisions in daily life.
