When making a [***decision***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making), usually involving a set of rational options.

When making a [***choice***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice), the decision arises from a different place. By setting aside my experience, internal debate, and personal biases, I gain the freedom to ***choose***.

I open myself to new possibilities, new ways of seeing the world, or new experiences. Choice involves embracing the unknown, inviting creativity, and taking risk.

Choice is *brave* where decisions are *fearful*.

Choice *expands*, where decisions *limit*.

Choice *creates*, where decisions *protect*.


You can choose...or you can *choose* to *decide*.


I become open and vulnerable to a *new possibility*, a new way of seeing the world, or a new experience.   Choice is about something unknown, something creative, and may involve some risk and reward.  


> More is lost by indecision than wrong decision. Indecision is the thief of opportunity. It will steal you blind.” — Cicero

A decision can be explained, a choice simply *exists*.

By having participants pick ice cream multiple time this exercise highlights just how instinctively we try to justify ourselves.

It also demonstrates the surprising power and freedom of simply declaring “I choose,” no explanation required.

That small but profound distinction can open up new personal insights and help people experience a real breakthrough in how they approach decisions in daily life.
