**Note**: This post is about *self-development*, *building confidence*, and offers *a tool* I learned to use many years ago, when making tough calls...*or not*. This can be helpful, but only if the reader steps outside of his or her comfort zone.  If you know anyone gripped in moments of indecision now-and-then, maybe throw this their way... <br />

I recently witnessed a friend hitting an indecisive moment, about something fairly mundane (trying to pick what to cook guests for dinner, and if there was time for a grocery store run).  It was a pretty ordinary moment all of us go through, especially when entertaining guests.  But in my friend's case, his wavering and indecision went on for several minutes-and it became THE topic of discussion for nearly half an hour-with everyone present making suggestions to help *bring closure* for our friend's amusing moment of *indecision*.<br />

Now if you k*now me*, you know that I had a hard time seeing a friend going through moments of indecisio like that-*especially* when it had occured several times. My friend sometimes [*vascillated*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vacillate) on  I wanted to help.  We all have our OCD things, that's ***ok*** and human.  But ***severe indecisiveness***, if *it occurs a lot* for someone, could signal an issue with confidence that can be

# The *Power* of Choice vs. The *Purpose* of Decision

We often sell ourselves short from from stepping into a new possibility,  simply because we are worried about making the ‚Äú***wrong decision***‚Äù.  We‚Äôve all been there‚Äîtorn between multiple paths, searching desperately for ***reasons*** or ***justifications*** to confirm we‚Äôve made the *smartest move*. <br /> 

**But what if we *shifted* our perspective, here**?  What if there is a meaningful ***distinction*** *between* ***making a decision*** and ***exercising a choice***‚Äî**and recognizing that difference to gift ourselves new avenues of freedom and confidence**? <br />

## Defining ‚ÄúDecision‚Äù

***Decide*** is one of those " &#42;cide" words which aren't always rooted in *creation*: *suicide*, *insecticide*, or *genocide* are but three " words shared with "***decide***"-and for good reason: the Latin root for "***cide***" is ***caedere*** which means "**to cut**" or "***to kill***."  The root "*cide*" carries significant weight, for serious situations, deliberate acts, and justifications.  Stay with me on this, because it gets interesting. <br />

When we ***decide***: we are applying *reason* to *eliminate alternatives*, effectively *killing* each alternative...until a *single* thing is left...and *that* becomes ***the decision***.  Often we look at this as arriving at the ***best decision***, or "***the right decision***". <br />

When making a [***decision***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making), usually involving a set of rational options. <br />

A ***decision*** is typically rooted in analysis or reasoning: you consider options, weigh pros and cons, gather data-you might even consult with friends and experts. Then you pick the path that appears most *rational*. **In many ways, decisions are about** ***protection***: <br />

‚Ä¢	**Decisions protect us from perceived risk by ensuring we follow a logical process**. <br />
‚Ä¢	**Decisions protect us from *blame*, because we have a line of reasoning that justifies why we did what we did**. <br />

Decisions are often crucial-picking which flight to book, choosing how to invest your money, or planning a project budget. The ability to think carefully and logically is vital for problem-solving, especially when the stakes are high.  ***But this protective function can backfire*** **if we become paralyzed by fear of** ‚Äú***What if I decide wrong***?‚Äù <br /> 

When we overemphasize the process of deciding, we might lose sight of possibility and creativity. We focus on justifying ourselves to others or to our own self-critical mind, forgetting that *not every situation* demands an exhaustive explanation.  **Enter Decision's Backup-Pilot**: ***choice***.

## Embracing ‚ÄúChoice‚Äù

A ***choice***, on the other hand, *simply* ***is***. It doesn‚Äôt always come with a mental checklist or a bullet-pointed rationale. Instead of an exercise in logic, a ***choice*** can be an act of *creation*‚Äîgiving life to something new, opening doors you hadn‚Äôt previously considered. <br />

Think about how ***choices*** exist in our language: <br />

**Choice** ***expands***, where **decisions** ***limit***. <br />

**Choice** ***creates***, where **decisions** ***protect***. <br />

**Choice** is ***brave*** where **decisions** are ***fearful***. <br />

A decision can always be *explained*, a choice simply *exists*. <br />

When making a [***choice***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice), the decision arises from a different place. By setting aside my experience, internal debate, and personal biases, I gain the freedom to ***choose***.  <br />

In ***choosing*** I become open and vulnerable to a ***new possibility***, a new way of seeing the world, or a new experience. ***Choice*** is about something unknown, something creative, and may involve *some risk* and *reward*. <Br />

***Choosing*** can often be about **making a** ***choice*** **purely for the** ***sake of choosing***: **not** applying reason, **not** applying logic, **not** removing or disqualifying the **other** ***choices***. <br /> 

It is tempting to still ***give reasons*** when making a ***choice*** but that's no bueno and goes *against* what ***choosing is*** and turns it into a ***decision****: ultimately at the bottom of *every* ***decision*** is *either* fundamental ***choice*** **or** fundamental ***reason***: "*I choose to believe* ..." or "*I choose to trust* ..."-but *adding* "***because***" immediately ***makes it a reason***! **And by using** ***reason*** **in any** ***choice***, **you're absolving yourself from the responsibility of** ***owning your choice***.  You didn't make a choice if you applied *external* reasons, analysis, or factors.  And *that means*: if your ***choice*** didn't work out, it becomes the *fault* of the *reason* or *reasoning process* if it fails. **This is why *truly learning* to embrace *choice* is *SCARY***: **choice demands responsibility for** ***making the choice***! üòâ **But *that's* also why *choosing* is a such HUGE *confidence-builder***!! <br />

# *When* to *Decide* and *When* to *Choose*

Both decisions and choices have value, and they have their place in different scenarios. The ***trick*** is to discern *which* one suits the moment: <br />
1.	**High-Stakes, Technical, or Complex Situations** ‚Äì Here, a decision process with clear pros, cons, data, and justifications makes sense. You likely want to protect resources (time, money, safety), so carefully thinking it through is wise. <br />
2.	**Everyday Moments or Creative Exploration** ‚Äì When brainstorming new ideas, exploring career possibilities, or just simply deciding how to spend your leisure time-sometimes a *pure choice* is more ***liberating***. You don‚Äôt need bulletproof logic to "*decide*" you want cook tacos for dinner...or if time to learn the piano...or try your hand at painting. <br />

Learning that you *can* ***choose***...or you can ***choose to decide*** is a *powerful thing* that history's most successful entrepreneurs, executives, and our greatest explorers all figured out.  <br />

Learning to move fluidly between ***decision-making*** *and* ***choosing*** helps you cut through hesitation ***and*** **build confidence** at the same time. Ask yourself, ‚Äú*Is this a situation where I need to protect something, or is this a situation where I want to create something*?‚Äù A decision helps guard established norms or resources; a choice can spark a new creation or possibility.

# Overcoming the Fear of ‚Äú*Being Wrong*‚Äù

Often, the dread of making an incorrect decision comes from thinking every step we take must be ***rationally validated***. **That‚Äôs a lot of pressure**! If you are in a place where you want to spark *fresh ideas* or *break free* from stagnation, ***let yourself choose*** without *over-explaining* or feeling you *owe a justification* to others‚Äîor even yourself. <br />

A few practical tips to relax into this mindset: <br />
1.	**Practice ‚ÄúSmall Choices‚Äù** ‚Äì Begin with tiny, low-consequence choices. Skip the mental acrobatics and ***just pick*** *something*‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs which new coffee flavor to try or which neighborhood to explore on a weekend. These little acts of unencumbered *choice* **build your tolerance for the unknown**.
2.	**Let Go of Over-Explaining** ‚Äì Notice when you start defending yourself unnecessarily. It‚Äôs often a sign you‚Äôre anxious about how others may judge you, or a sign you're not feeling confident about the decision.  **Recognize that *you have the right* to choose what aligns *for you*‚Äîno lengthy explanations required**!!
3.	**Trust Your Inner Compass** ‚Äì If you‚Äôve already done your due diligence in those *decision-heavy* areas of your life (school, career, a mortgage), then **give yourself permission** to *trust your instincts* elsewhere. Let your curiosity lead, focusing on ***what you might create*** *instead of* fixating on possible pitfalls.

## The Confidence Connection

**Confidence grows when we realize that life isn‚Äôt solely about ‚Äú*getting it right*‚Äù all the time**; it‚Äôs also about ***experiencing***, ***learning***, and ***generating*** new possibilities for ourselves. A ***powerful shift*** happens when we see that *not every move* requires exhaustive justification. *Some* moments call for a ***decision*** based on reason, while *others* blossom best when we simply ***choose*** and see where it leads.

Being confident means respecting both dimensions‚Äîknowing you are capable of solid [***decision-making***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) when you need it, but also *free to* [***choose***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice) without fear of condemnation or second-guessing. By embracing this distinction, you reclaim your agency and move through life with a deep sense of possibility.

# Wrapping Up

When you feel yourself teetering on the edge of a big question‚Äîhesitant, anxious, worried about ‚Äú*the right answer*‚Äù‚Äîtake a moment to ask: "***Is this a moment to decide‚Ä¶ or a moment to choose***?" If you‚Äôre protecting your resources or ensuring critical objectives are met, making a structured ***decision*** will serve you well. But if you‚Äôre seeking to *create* something *fresh* or ***free yourself*** **from perfectionism**, lean into ***choice***. <br />

**A decision explains and *protects*; a choice creates and simply *exists***. <br />

***Give up*** the constant need to justify. That is the *first step* into a world where you can lovingly safeguard what needs protecting (***deciding***), but ***also*** joyfully leap into the unknown when it calls (***choosing***). Learning the distinction between ***decision*** vs ***choice*** (and then ***exercising choice***) tkes a little effort, but eventually it comes naturally and fosters greater confidence-and dissolves the fear of ‚Äú*being wrong*,‚Äù allowing you to live, learn, and create: one ***choice*** at-a-time! <br /> <br />
