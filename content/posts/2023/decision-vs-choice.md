**Note**: This post is about *self-development* and *building confidence* when making tough calls...*or not* making them. It's *my own* thinking on the topic of "*Decision vs Choice*" from a *place of empowerment*, not necesarilly from a place of knowledge or *expertise* on the subject.  So this write-up is not not for *everyone* or "one size fits all".  *Also please note*: if you are undergoing treatment for [OCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive‚Äìcompulsive_disorder) or have the diagnosis, I would recommend skipping this write-up altogether. I can't imagine something as *intolerable* for someone with OCD, as contemplating *making choices* the way I lay it out.  It's already kind of a stretch for non-OCD folks! <br />

I recently witnessed a friend hitting an indecisive moment, about something fairly mundane: trying to pick what to cook guests for dinner, and if there was time for a grocery store run. It was a pretty ordinary moment all of us go through, when entertaining guests.  But in my friend's case, he kept second-guessing himself and adding new options/ideas for what *might be good* to cook for dinner. Just as quickly as he setted on a meal that seemed to please everybody, he would find x or y reasons why that meal option might *not work*. This wavering, about what to cook, went on for several minutes-and it became THE topic of discussion for nearly half an hour-with everybody making suggestions to ease our friend's amusing moment of *indecision*.<br />

Now if you know *me*, then you know that I have a hard seeing indecision-*especially* if it's for something not-too-important, but still taking up a lot of time and energy. My friend [*vascillated*](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vacillate) between so many options-each option with its own data pont-that I felt compelled to ask if they're ok. I mean, we *all* have our moments of indecision, it's ***ok*** and very human; however, his moment ***indecisiveness*** seemed to be one of many during our visit.  This kind of thing may be nothing, but sometimes it also signals a deeper issue with anxiety or self doubt-both things we don't like seeing close friends go through. So after everything got settled, I pulled my friend aside and walked him through an exercise that a mentor once taught me: on distinguishing ***deciding*** from ***choosing*** during moments of indecision. And I am going to try and distill that lesson here in this post.<br /> <br />

> More is lost by indecision than wrong decision. Indecision is the thief of opportunity. It will steal you blind.‚Äù ‚Äî Cicero

## The *Power* of Choice vs. The *Purpose* of Decision

We often sell ourselves short from from new opportunities, or stepping into some new possibility, simply because we are worried about making the ‚Äú***wrong decision***‚Äù.  We‚Äôve all been there‚Äîtorn between multiple paths, searching for ***reasons*** or ***justifications*** to confirm we‚Äôve made the *smartest move*. <br /> 

**But what if we *shifted* our perspective, here**?  What if there is a meaningful ***distinction*** to be made *between* ***making a decision***...and ***exercising a choice***?  And what if **recognizing that difference gave us new avenues of freedom and confidence**? <br />

To get rolling on this, we first need to define *the two big terms here*, so that we can make that powerful ***distinction*** *between* ***decision*** and ***choice***-let's go!

## Defining ‚Äú*Decision*‚Äù

***Decide*** is one of those "&#42;*cide*" words which aren't always rooted in *creation*: sui*cide*, insecti*cide*, or geno*cide* are but three negative words shared with "***decide***"-and for good reason: the Latin root for "***cide***" is ***caedere***, which means "**to cut**" or "***to kill***."  The root "*cide*" carries significant weight, for serious situations, deliberate acts, and justifications.  *Stay with me* on this, it gets *interesting*... <br />

When we "***decide***" or make a "***decision***": we are applying *reason* to ***eliminate alternatives***, effectively "*killing* off" each alternative...until a *single* thing is left...and *that* becomes ***the decision***.  Often we call this arriving at the ***best decision***, or "***the right decision***". <br />

When making a [***decision***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making), it usually involves a set of rational options typically rooted in analysis or reasoning: you consider everything, weigh pros and cons, gather data-you might even consult with friends and experts. *Then you pick* the path that appears *most rational*, reasonable, or has the least risk. **In many ways, *decisions* are about** ***protection***: <br />

‚Ä¢	**Decisions protect us from perceived risk by ensuring we follow a logical process**. <br />
‚Ä¢	**Decisions protect us from *blame*, because we have a line of reasoning that justifies why we did what we did**. <br />

***Decisions*** are often crucial-picking which flight to book, choosing how to invest your money, or planning a project budget. The ability to think carefully and logically is vital for problem-solving, especially when the stakes are high.  ***But this protective function can sometimes backfire*** **if we become paralyzed by fear of** ‚Äú***What if I decide wrong***?‚Äù <br /> 

When we *overemphasize* the process of deciding, we might lose sight of possibility or creativity. We focus on *justifying* to ourselves, to others, or to our own self-critical mind, forgetting that *not every situation* demands an exhaustive explanation. **Enter *Decision's* Backup-Pilot**: ***Choice***.

## Leveraging ‚ÄúChoice‚Äù

So we just defined what a ***decision*** typically is.  A ***choice***, on the other hand, *simply* ***is***. It doesn‚Äôt always come with a mental checklist or a bullet-point rationale. Instead of an exercise in logic, a ***choice*** can be an act of *creation*‚Äîgiving life to something new, opening doors you hadn‚Äôt previously considered. <br />

**Think about how the word** "***choice***" **exists in our language, compared to** "***decisions***": <br />

**Choice** ***expands***, where **decisions** ***limit***. <br />

**Choice** ***creates***, where **decisions** ***protect***. <br />

**Choice** is ***brave*** where **decisions** are ***fearful***. <br />

A **decision** can always be ***explained***, a *true* **choice** simply ***exists***. <br />

When making a [***choice***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice), the "*decision*" arises from a *different place*. By setting aside my experience, internal debate, and personal biases, I gain the freedom to truly ***choose***.  <br />

In ***choosing***, I become open and vulnerable to a ***new possibility***, a new way of seeing the world, or a new experience. ***Choice*** is about something unknown, something creative, and may sometimes even involve a little *risk* and *reward*. <Br />

***Choosing*** can often be about **making a** ***choice*** **purely for the** ***sake of choosing***: **not** applying reason, **not** applying logic, **not** removing or disqualifying the **other** ***choices***. <br /> 


Here are a few ways to recognize a ‚Äúchoice‚Äù moment:
1.	**Spontaneity & Freedom** ‚Äì You aren‚Äôt required to lay out all the reasons; you‚Äôre simply free to act.
2.	**Possibility & Creativity** ‚Äì Choosing can be about generating something fresh‚Äîa new direction, a new mindset, or a new approach to a challenge.
3.	**No Justification Needed** ‚Äì While it‚Äôs perfectly fine to have reasons, a choice doesn‚Äôt need them. Sometimes you just feel moved to go in a certain direction.

When you choose, you tap into your power to create. You aren‚Äôt bound by having to ‚Äúget it right‚Äù through a rational formula. You step into a moment of true ownership: ‚ÄúThis is what I‚Äôm doing, because I choose to.‚Äù

## When A Choice Morphs Into A Decision

It is tempting to still ***give reasons*** when *making a* ***choice***-but *strictly-speaking*: a lot of *reasons* added will turn your ***choice*** ---> *into* a ***decision***.  That's totally ***OK***, but now you've moved into the ***decision*** realm and may want to double-check: "am I doing something creative or low-stakes?" -- becuase, if not, then switching to a ***decision*** makes sense. But sometmies we "*slip into*" ***decision-mode*** without knowing it, and that might go *against* what ***choosing is all about***.  Your mileage may vary, and sometimes we *should* examine a ***choice*** we're making-aer we keeping it ***a choice*** or does it need to really be a ***decision***?  <br />

**Ultimately at the bottom of *every*** ***decision*** **is *either* fundamental** ***choice*** ***or*** **fundamental** ***reason***: "*I choose to believe* ..." or "*I choose to trust* ..."--but *adding* "***because***" immediately ***makes it a reason***, and techically *could* transform your ***choice*** into a ***decision***. Because you're using ***reason*** in your ***choice***. And the *spirit* of ***truly choosing*** (compared to ***deciding***) asks you to be spontaneous and ***less reasonable*** in low-stakes or creative situations.  So if you're adding very many **reasons** into your "***choice***", **you're kind of absolving yourself from the responsibility of** ***owning your choice***.  *Not always*, but its hard to say you exercised ***choice*** if you applied a lot of *external* reasons, analysis, or factors.  <br />

**And this is why *truly learning* to embrace *choice* is *SCARY* for some people: **choice demands responsibility for** ***making the choice***! *Owning it*! üòâ **But *that's* also why true exercising real honest-to-goodness *choice* is a such *HUGE* *confidence-booster***!!** When you ***CHOOSE*** you are declaring that you don't need to justify *making-the-call* to anyone else. <br />

**It's hard to explain this concept in writing**, but ***trust me***-when we can distinguish ***deciding*** *from* ***choosing*** in our minds *on-the-fly*-intentionally practicing ***choice*** allows us to become *more decisive* and way ***more confident***.

# *When* to *Decide* and *When* to *Choose*?

Both decisions and choices have *value*, and they each have their place in different scenarios. The ***trick*** is to discern *which* one suits the moment: <br />
1.	**High-Stakes, Technical, or Complex Situations** ‚Äì Here, a decision process with clear pros, cons, data, and justifications makes sense. You likely want to protect resources (time, money, safety), so carefully *thinking it through* is wise. <br />
2.	**Everyday Moments or Creative Exploration** ‚Äì When brainstorming new ideas, exploring career possibilities, or just simply deciding how to spend your leisure time-sometimes a *pure choice* is more ***liberating***. You don‚Äôt *need* bulletproof logic or justifications to "*decide*" you want cook tacos for dinner...or learn the piano...or try your hand at painting. <br />

Learning that you even *can* ***choose***...or that you can ***choose to decide*** is a *powerful ability* seen in history's most successful entrepreneurs, executives, and our greatest explorers all figured out.  <br />

Learning to move fluidly between ***decision-making*** *and* ***choosing*** helps you cut through hesitation ***and*** **build confidence** at the same time. Ask yourself, ‚Äú*Is this a situation where I need to protect something, or is this a situation where I want to create something*?‚Äù A decision helps guard established norms or resources; a choice can spark a new creation or possibility.

# Overcoming the Fear of ‚Äú*Being Wrong*‚Äù

Often, the dread of making an *incorrect* ***decision*** comes from thinking every step we take *must be* ***rationally validated***. **That‚Äôs a lot of pressure**! If you are in a place where you want to spark a *fresh idea* or *break free* from stagnation, ***let yourself choose*** without *over-explaining* or feeling you *owe a justification* to anybody-even to yourself. <br />

**A few practical tips to relax into this powerful mindset**: <br />
1.	**Practice ‚ÄúSmall Choices‚Äù** ‚Äì Begin with tiny, low-consequence ***choices***. Skip the mental acrobatics and ***just pick*** *something*‚Äî*anything*: maybe it‚Äôs which new coffee flavor to try, or which neighborhood to explore on a weekend. These little acts of unencumbered ***choice*** **build your tolerance for the unknown**. <br />
2.	**Let Go of Over-Explaining** ‚Äì Notice when you start defending yourself unnecessarily. It‚Äôs often a sign you‚Äôre anxious about how others may judge you, or a sign you're not feeling confident about the decision.  **Recognize that *you have the right* to choose what aligns *for you*‚Äîno lengthy explanations required**!! <br />
3.	**Trust Your Inner Compass** ‚Äì If you‚Äôve already done your due diligence in those *decision-heavy* areas of your life (school, career, a home), then **give yourself permission** to *trust your instincts* elsewhere! Let your curiosity lead, focusing on ***what you might create*** *instead of* fixating on possible pitfalls.

## The Confidence Connection

**Confidence grows when we realize that life isn‚Äôt solely about ‚Äú*getting it right*‚Äù *all* the time**; it‚Äôs *also* about ***experiencing***, ***learning***, and ***generating*** new possibilities for ourselves. A ***powerful shift*** happens when we can see that *not every move* requires exhaustive justification. *Some* moments call for a ***decision*** based on reason, while *other* moments unfold best when we simply ***choose*** and see where it leads! <br />

Being confident means respecting *both* dimensions‚Äîknowing you are capable of solid [***decision-making***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) when you need it, but also *free to* [***choose***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice) without fear of condemnation or second-guessing. **By embracing this *distinction*, you reclaim your agency and move through life with a deep sense of possibility**.

# Wrapping Up

When you feel yourself teetering on the edge of a big question‚Äîhesitant, anxious, worried about ‚Äú*the right answer*‚Äù‚Äîtake a moment to ask: "***Is this a moment to decide‚Ä¶ or a moment to choose***?" If you‚Äôre protecting your resources or ensuring critical objectives are met, making a structured ***decision*** is the way. But if you‚Äôre seeking to *create* something *fresh* or ***free yourself*** **from perfectionism**, lean hard into ***choice***. <br />

**A decision explains and *protects*; a choice *creates* and simply *exists***. <br />

***Give up*** the constant need to justify. That is the *first step* into a world where you can safeguard what needs protecting (***deciding***), but ***also*** be creative or free when you want (***choosing***). Learning the ***distinction*** *between* ***decision*** vs ***choice*** (and then ***exercising choice***) tkes a little effort, but eventually it comes naturally and fosters greater confidence-and dissolves the fear of ‚Äú*being wrong*,‚Äù allowing you to live, learn, and create: one ***choice*** at-a-time! <br /> <br />
