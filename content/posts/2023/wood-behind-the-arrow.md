*Multitasking* is often glorified as the ultimate productivity "*skill*", but in reality it's just a low-value hack yielding slow (and often inaccurate) results.  Multitasking is a deceptive trap, because the human brain isn’t wired to focus on *multiple* complex tasks *simultaneously*. Instead, what we call “***multitasking***” is actually [**rapid task-switching**](https://www.apa.org/topics/research/multitasking)—and it comes [**at a cost**](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2018/10/decade-data-reveals-heavy-multitaskers-reduced-memory-psychologist-says). Each time you *shift focus*, your brain expends energy reorienting itself, [**leading to decreased efficiency**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/curtsteinhorst/2020/02/20/how-multitasking-erodes-productivity-and-dings-your-iq/) and higher chances of mistakes or delays. <br />

Studies show that [multitasking can reduce productivity](https://www.verywellmind.com/multitasking-2795003) (some show it reduces productivity by *up to* 40%!) and significantly impacts the quality of your work. It also increases stress and fosters a false sense of accomplishment, as we confuse "busy-ness" with effectiveness. **The antidote**? [***Single-tasking**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/organization/what-is-single-tasking-and-is-it-better-than-multi-tasking). Dedicate your attention to *one task* at-a-time, complete it, and then move to the next. Not only will you finish faster, but the results will also reflect your full potential. <br />

***Easier said, than done***—right?  I get it.  In the execution of our taskwork, it's tempting to *pause* and "*check-in*" on other concerns: the office Slack/Email, the status of other related tasks, etc.  This is especially tough when working a long-form task where there are a lot of individual steps.  For these *multitasking* is only a distraction and the only way out (to a completed a task) is *through*.

### Put All Your Wood Behind A Single Arrow

There's a phrase I like to use for helping teams eliminate the *fractured focus*, and lost productivity, from multitasking—and it comes from wording [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) and [Scott McNealy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy) used a lot in the 90s:

>"Put all your wood behind one arrowhead."

The idea expressed here is to **focus all your energy and effort on one specific goal** (or *task*).  Multitasking is *the opposite of this*, a ***diffusion of effort***: which means no single strand of activity gets fully realized.  **So no arrow *hits its target***.  "*Multitasking*" is nothing short of a diffusion of your efforts = less (or nothing) getting done. And what *does* get completed with "*multitasking*" always has a chance of *not being* "*done*" to the quality or accuracy you get with ***single-tasking***. <br />

Of course the phrase "**the *un-aimed* arrow never misses**" also comes to mind, too; however, your team (or personal goals) already *have an aim* (hopefully): something you're trying to accomplish, your main priority or north star.  "*Multitasking*" can ruin your aim!  So, when *aiming* we must bring *intentional focus* (prioritizing, and *single-tasking*).  Elminating "*multitasking", wherever practical, is hard in some cultures—but I have seen *single-tasking* work. <br />

Another variation I recently saw on this concept, and phrasing, is:

> "Experienced hunters bring only one arrow. They know how to aim (and they take plenty of time, when aiming), and they put *all the wood* behind that one arrow."

This is why we establish an *intentional backlog* in Agile and other project methodologies, and why your own personal productivity benefits from prioritizing: you can't do it ***all***, and so getting good at *aiming* (choosing one key *thing to finish* at-a-time, prioritizing tasks) allows you to put each task behind a single deliverable, or "*thing done*" (arrow!).  This ultimately increases your effictiveness and productivity, reduces your stress, and increases your sense of accomplishment. <br />

***And remember***: when you're knocking things out *one-at-a-time* rapidly --- **people on the outside only see "*multitasking*", anyway**! <br />

Happy (single)Tasking!!
