I have seen the unsurprising news about RTO mandates ramping-up, and this trend may even result in my own team experiencing mandatory Return-To-Office at some point.  I have already heard about other legal firms in my space inching toward Hybrid days for their IT staff.  Hybrid being a mix of one or two on-premises days, with an "anchor day" thrown in, and the rest of the workweek remote.<br />

Ultimately the <i>location</i> where Knowledge Work is <i>done</i> had already long become a flexible thing for tech workers in many roles, <i>years before</i> Covid lockdowns increased our awareness.  But where you work is up to the company you're working for, and rank-and-file and tech staff like myself have no real say here; however, the marketplace for IT jobs <i>does</i> have a say.  Even with the metric shift of instability in tech jobs going on, I still see and hear about tech colleagues taking opportunities where Remote Work has become a standard for many technical roles.  As expected, offering remote or WFH has become <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/return-to-office-mandates-how-to-lose-your-best-performers/">a very difficult perk to remove</a>.<br />

So with the above in mind, I thought I would list my own thoughts about Remote Work / Work From Home in 2023.  I experienced a tripling in my own productivity, while also witnessing struggling from other co-workers at my employer.  It's a mixed-bag, but for Information Tech Knowledge Workers, there's an argument to be made for productivity gains (but it seems your average HR person only sees the risks).  Let's get into it... <br />

The push to mandate a return-to-office policy (for IT and tech workers, anyway) is increasingly at odds with the realities of modern business and employee expectations. For decades, technology professionals have been tethered to physical offices, battling long commutes, distractions, and less-than-ideal working conditions. Now, having experienced massive productivity gains, many tech staff seeing companies clawing-back their policies. <br /> 

I recall over the past decade deploying secure VPN and remote Citrix and VDI solutions, and seeing attorneys and the c-suite literally work remote before major events like a trial, a team retreat, or other focused activity.  When it came to engineering and creating deliverables for major projects, myself, I was sometimes extended remote-work options.  My most recent, before Covid, had been the One Manhattan West networking project I worked on.  At no point could I have efficiently and quickly nailed my timelines that year, if I had to work at our main offices prior each execution phase of that project. <br />

When it comes to tech and IT Knowledge Workers: 

### Remote Flexibility = Competitive Advantage
Remote work arrangements have long been proven to increase employee satisfaction, productivity, and work-life balance—factors.  That was true before 2020. IT professionals such as network engineers, cloud architects, cybersecurity analysts, and even certain levels of helpdesk support staff can often operate at peak efficiency from anywhere with a stable internet connection. Similarly, systems administrators, software developers, and project managers routinely use collaboration tools, cloud platforms, and secure VPN connections that make the physical office essentially optional. They coordinate complex deployments, troubleshoot complex technical issues, and streamline workflows—all without having to sit in the same conference room.

### Cost Savings and Talent Pool Expansion
A remote-capable workforce can substantially reduce an organization’s operational expenses. When on-prem hardware technicians—who must maintain physical equipment—are supported by remote systems architects and engineers, the company can maintain a smaller on-site footprint. Beyond cost considerations, hiring remotely means there is no need to restrict talent searches to the immediate vicinity of the company’s headquarters. Instead, businesses can tap into global talent pools, benefiting from professionals with specialized skills that might not exist in a limited geographic area.

### Attracting and Retaining Top Talent
Mandating a full return to the office, without any hybrid option for your best players, risks alienating the best and brightest in your team. The IT industry is fiercely competitive, and top professionals have options. Many senior engineers and cloud experts prefer environments that trust them to manage their own time. If forced to come back to an office for no productivity-related reason, they are more likely to leave for an employer that offers more flexibility. Consider this scenario: A highly skilled network security engineer, valued for her rare skill set, might be commuting 14 miles into a city center. During peak rush hour, that 14-mile drive can take two grueling hours—each way. That’s four hours a day spent sitting in traffic. Over the course of a week, that’s nearly a full extra workday wasted in a car, contributing nothing to her productivity or the company’s bottom line. Such lost time prompts key contributors to rethink whether the commute is worth it. Often, it’s not—and they go where flexibility is considered an asset rather than a grudging concession.

### Real-World Productivity Costs of Mandatory RTO
Teams forced back to the office often face unseen morale and productivity losses. Employees who resent the commute and the rigid structure are less likely to linger after traditional working hours. Take the helpdesk staff who, while remote, might respond to a late request or urgent ticket a bit beyond their official end-of-day simply because they are already at home and there is no psychological barrier to helping out. By contrast, when mandated to be on-site, the same employees often pack up and leave the moment the clock hits quitting time. They’ve already spent time commuting, and they’re determined not to lose another hour of personal life. The result is a further erosion of flexibility and productivity that once benefited the organization.

### Hybrid Models for the Best of Both Worlds

Not all IT jobs are suited for full-time remote work. Certain technician roles must interact physically with hardware, and even systems architects and engineers must interact with networking, storage, or other infra. Yet even these jobs can often be structured as a hybrid model -- but it requires task-management and planning to handle hands-on tasks, dividing what taskwork can be worked on remotely. By acknowledging that not all IT roles are identical and granting flexibility where possible, companies demonstrate respect for individual circumstances, leading to stronger job satisfaction, reduced turnover, and sustained productivity gains.<br />

 I wholly admit I am not a work culture expert or know much about HR, but I do know a thing or two about office politics. And I have already seen some hot sports opinions thrown around by staff that always was going to have mandatory RTO, and my sense is that many companies will throw their hands in the air and execute non-Hybrid mandatory RTO to please a precious few. That could backfire. We'll see! <br />

 At any rate, I enjoy the benefits of Remote Work currently, in my enterprise IT role, and with my own 1.5 to 2-hour commute to my employeer's main office...I have understandably come to a specific point of view here. <br />

My advice to companies struggling with RTO, and entertaining the idea removing Remote or Hybrid for your IT staff: <br />
