**Time for some yearly hot-sports-opinions about coding...** <br /><br />

Tabs are better than spaces.  They just are.  I said what I said. <br />  

Vanilla code is best, frameworks often add unnecessary bulk. <br />

Readable code > clever code. <br />

People, not code, are the most important part of your job. <br />

QA is absolutely necessary and you need non-engineers doing it. <br />

The commodification of AI & ML will increase algorithmic bias; which will increase the marginalization of URMs (UnderRepresented Minorities) <br />

Incremental refactoring is Ok.  Perfect is the enemy of *Good* ***and*** steady-progression.<br />

It's OK for a code base to not be 100% uniform and adhere to best practices and patterns at all times. It's *not* OK to be lazy. <br />

Opinions change overall time - and we don't need a big refactoring effort for every opinion change. <br />

Most software is over-engineered. <br />

The rule on our team is if you need it once, just do it. If you need it twice, ***standardize the process***. If you need it three times, automate it. <br />

As a PM, always saying "that's a great idea, I'll add it to the backlog..." will drive your engineers crazy.  If there's iteration room, and it's low-hanging fruit or minor user-story, maybe let an engineer chase that rabbit-hole for one sprint.
