When I was in high school I originally wanted to become a civil engineer.  Though I ended up in a very different engineering niche, public infrastructure remained an interest for me. So when I read “***Engineering in Plain Sight***” (***An Illustrated Field Guide to the Constructed Environment***) by **Grady Hillhouse**, I found it to be an accessible, visually rich exploration of the infrastructure that underpins our everyday lives. <br />

Presented as a kind of “field guide” to modern civil engineering, it breaks down complex technical concepts into easy-to-understand explanations and eye-catching illustrations. Hillhouse, a civil engineer and creator of the popular Practical Engineering YouTube channel, designed the book to help non-experts appreciate the structural and mechanical marvels that often go unnoticed because they’re so common—things like highways, bridges, dams, utility poles, storm drains, railways, and water systems. <br />

In essence, the book walks you through the myriad physical systems that supply us with clean water, stable electricity, smooth roads, secure buildings, and efficient drainage. Each chapter focuses on a particular domain—transportation, water infrastructure, energy delivery, or public works—and explains how these components evolved, how they function, how engineers solve design challenges, and what makes them reliable, safe, and (often) elegantly simple. Rich illustrations and diagrams are integral to the narrative, showing cutaways, internal mechanisms, and comparative schematics that illuminate how a bridge supports its load, how water is safely channeled through a storm drain system, and why a dam’s shape matters for stability and environmental impact. <br />

Though comprehensive, the tone and approach remain conversational and kept me interested throughout the whole book. Hillhouse avoids jargon where possible and uses relatable examples and metaphors to ensure that readers come away not only with an understanding of these everyday marvels, but with a newfound sense of wonder and respect for the systems that quietly maintain modern life. <br />

### My Key Takeaways...

•	The infrastructure we take for granted—roads, pipes, dams, and power lines—is the result of sophisticated engineering principles and centuries of innovation.
•	Simple, visually guided explanations help demystify complex concepts and materials, allowing readers without technical backgrounds to grasp how everyday structures work.
•	Understanding the purpose, design, and operation of common infrastructure components fosters greater appreciation and encourages more informed discussions about public works and community development.
•	The interplay of science, technology, economics, and environmental considerations shapes how engineers design and maintain the systems that keep society running.
