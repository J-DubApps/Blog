The opinions expressed on julianwest.me are solely my own and do not reflect the views of my employer, my friends and relatives, or any other carbon-based lifeform.  
I may occasionally review products that I personally purchased or already own. I will not respond to solicitations to review products, nor do I accept loaner/demo products to review or blog about.
I own, or have owned, some stock in a few of the tech companies I routinely blog, brag, or rant about including: Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, IBM, Solar City, and Tesla.  
As an information technology professional who often works under various NDAs, I adhere to employer policies governing blogging. Consequently I do not discuss my employers, projects, nor will I comment on past or present matters protected by attorney/client privelege.
